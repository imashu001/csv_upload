1
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:14,892
<i> London in the 1960's. Everyone had a story about the Krays. </i>

2
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:18,672
<i> You could walk into any pub to hear a lie or two about them. </i>

3
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,200
<i> But I was there
and I'm not careless with the truth. </i>

4
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,072
<i> They were brothers, but bound
by more than blood. They were twins as well. </i>

5
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,472
<i> Counterparts. Gangster-princes
of the city they meant to conquer. </i>

6
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:38,132
<i> Ron Kray was a one-man London mob. </i>

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,032
<i> Bloodthirsty, illogical and funny as well. </i>

8
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,624
<i> My Reggie was different. </i>

9
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,392
<i> Once in a lifetime do
you find a street fighting man like Reg. </i>

10
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:53,848
<i> Believe me when I say it took
a lot of love for me to hate him the way I do. </i>

11
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,964
Good morning, Albie.
Good morning, sir.

12
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:11,300
Tea for two? Yeah, Albie.

13
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,940
Hello, boys!

14
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:22,672
How you doing? You all right? Put your cup of tea in, do you fancy it?

15
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:24,664
Yeah? No?

16
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:31,656
What's this? The old Dagenham Angila? Ought to 60 in .. what? 40 minutes or sommit like that?

17
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:37,100
Cor, it's a bit of you in that, innit?
All black and cramped and very sharp.
Yeah.

18
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,224
This one's really milky...for you.

19
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:43,348
Why don't you fuck off, Kray?
-Oh, I will, I will
.

20
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:48,808
Y'know, I don't want to keep you, you know, what with them ... them, y'know, rapists and murderers you got to lock away, eh nipper?

21
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:53,300
Where do you take a turd in there? Probably just hold it in, don't you?

22
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:00,180
Alright, then, have a lovely day. Cheer up.
It's nearly Christmas.

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,792
Forget about that.

24
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:06,492
Where's me driver, where's Frank?
- He can't get out of bed in the morning, Mitch.

25
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:10,416
He what?
- He ain't here, he ain't showed up. He's nah ain't here.

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,640
Alright. OK, well let's go get him then, should we? He lives on Ormsby Street, yeah?

27
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:19,300
Yeah, come and jump in.I'll give you a lift.
- Nah, you're alright, I'm going to walk.It's a lovely day for it.

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,340
Don't forget this lot. They're very important.
- I won't.

29
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:28,466
[whistles] Come on!
- I shall walk incredibly slowly!

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,092
Hi, Vera.How you doing? You good?- Yeah.- Lovely.

31
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:44,224
Rita, I was gonna knock on your door. But me mum said you left that in her kitchen.- I did!

32
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,548
Is that yours?
- It is! Oh, thanks ever so much!

33
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:48,300
No problem, you're welcome.
- Thanks, Reg.

34
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,592
Eastenders.

35
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:59,424
They won't talk to a policeman,
but they'll kiss a gangster. Ey?

36
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,380
Filthy, cockney bastards.

37
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,100
How about we clean your car for ya?

38
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,708
Is Frank about?

39
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:29,080
Frank!

40
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:36,448
Who are you?
- I'm Frances.Frank's sister.

41
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,424
Hear about, I recognize you. See, I recognize you. You was a little bit younger, then. You got grown up, didn't ya?

42
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:44,308
It happens.

43
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,424
What have you got there?
- A sweet.

44
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,108
That's not any sweet, is it? That's a Lemon Sherbert, that is. Mind if I have a crack?

45
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:58,856
Go on.- Thanks.

46
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:02,300
Ah, that's nice, innit?

47
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,932
You're not supposed to chew it!
- No?

48
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,972
How else am I supposed to get to the sherbie bit?

49
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:15,380
By being patient.
- Nah.

50
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,248
Being patient doesn't get you what you want, does it?

51
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:23,464
Half a minute, Reg. Be right down.

52
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,516
Is he in trouble?
- Yea, he is.

53
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,724
Will you go out with me?
I'll go easy on him if you do.

54
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:37,908
Alright, but not for that reason.

55
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Saturday night?

56
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:44,772
Who are you talking to? You're half-dressed talking to a man in the door.
What's wrong with you, Frances?

57
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,616
Get back in the kitchen. Finish them dishes.
- This is yours.

58
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:50,640
Thank you.

59
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:07,100
If you oversleep again, Frank,
alright? It's back to the cheese shop.

60
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:11,116
Or the fish shop, or whatever shop it is you come from.
- Print.

61
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,423
Print shop.

62
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,832
Oh yeah? Well you'll be back to the fucking shit shop, you understand?
- Yup.

63
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,200
What does your sister do?

64
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:28,332
Oh, she goes to one of those, uh, Pitman colleges. Y'know? Typing? Shorthand?
- Yeah?

65
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,064
Well she's got a bit of class, mate. She's very elegant.
Where have you been hiding her?

66
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:38,900
She's been away.
She's a bit, umm, fragile, Reg.

67
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,316
Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,516
Hmm.- Stop here, Frank.

69
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:56,032
Four minutes. One job.

70
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,780
How long do you think it will take for him to figure it, Albie?
- A little bit of cat and mouse.

71
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:14,740
<i> Nipper Read was the copper on the Krays case
and he made his presence known. </i>

72
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:19,000
<i> He was heavy-footed, as they say. </i>

73
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:37,040
<i> So I stared at the back of this geezer's head
and the whole time I'm thinking ... umm: </i>

74
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:43,716
Give Ron Kray your sausage.

75
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,716
Give Ron ...

76
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,800
your fucking sausage.

77
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:57,600
Y'know?

78
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,592
I was drilling my eyes into the back of his head ...

79
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:09,624
Until I'm not even thinking it anymore.
I'm not even thinking.

80
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,564
I'm broadcasting it.

81
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:17,180
Until he turns around and you know what he says?
He says ...

82
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,264
"Hey, Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I've got no appetite for it."

83
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,472
Interesting.

84
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,332
<i> When my future brother in law 'interesting' said ... </i>
- Right?

85
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,548
<i> It meant he had no idea what he, or you or anyone else was talking about. </i>

86
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,232
Fascinating, Ron.

87
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,864
Fascinating.

88
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:44,624
<i> Ron had been sentenced to three years in prison for grievous bodily harm. </i>

89
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:49,572
<i> Near the end of his sentence, he was certified insane
and remanded to a mental hospital. </i>

90
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,552
<i> What was wanting was a friendly psychiatrist. </i>

91
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:57,748
Roger, when you say you want me to raspberry this man ...

92
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,468
I'm not sure of your vernacular. What do you mean?

93
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:05,748
Raspberry ripple. Cripple.- You want to cripple someone.

94
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,792
Yup.
That's right- Why is that?

95
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:13,416
Because, doctor, I'm afraid he may not be inclined ...

96
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,140
to provide a favorable evaluation to my employer.
- And who is your employer?

97
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,216
Ronnie Kray.

98
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,648
Is there hope, Doctor?

99
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,348
Excuse me a moment.

100
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,832
Take your time.

101
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:41,972
Ronald Kray possesses possibly the soundest mind
I've seen in 26 years in psychiatric practice.

102
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:47,372
In my view, to keep him here would be a waste of public resources.

103
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:57,264
A lifetime's integrity down the toilet.

104
00:09:57,332 --> 00:10:01,640
<i> The Queen would survive,
but God save the rest of us. </i>

105
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,832
Mr. Kray?

106
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,848
I hope you know what you're doing.
- Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I'm going back to London.
I'm going to take the ... take the car ...

107
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:19,802
Your brother has no real idea who or what he is. Nor does he trust his own senses.

108
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:23,116
I've never seen a man
so desperately in need of reassurance.

109
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,320
We all like a nice little compliment now and again, don't we?

110
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:30,048
Your brother is arbitrary, violent and a psychopath.- Alright.-
Probably paranoid schizophrenic.

111
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:35,292
What I'm trying to tell you is that he's off his fucking rocker.

112
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:42,064
It's called Stemetil. You need to give it to your brother twice a day, or there's going to be serious trouble.

113
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:52,925
<i> Oy Frances, the car is outside. </i>

114
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:05,989
Oh, heh, You've got glamour, Frances.
You're like an East End starlet.

115
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,359
East End harlot's more like it.

116
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:11,070
They're trousers, mum.
She doesn't look like a harlot.

117
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:12,768
What she's wearing doesn't matter.

118
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,123
When people see her with Reggie Kray,
they'll think she's a tart.

119
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:21,796
Why would you say that?
- He's a gangster, Frances. The Krays are gangsters
.

120
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,130
Well, I think he's sweet.- Oh, God.

121
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,278
And I'm going to kiss him, you hear me?

122
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,825
Hello.- Hello.

123
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,825
You look lovely
.

124
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,682
And so do you.

125
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,974
Hello. This is Big Pat. Hello, Bit Pat!
- Reggie.

126
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,561
How are you doing, you all right, mate? You all right?
- Nice to see you.

127
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,917
Big Pat's here to keep the riffraff out.

128
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:10,591
Always. *laughs*
- So how come you're letting us in, then, mate?

129
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,921
*laughs* Have a good night.
- Thanks.
- Thanks, mate. Cheers.

130
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:16,195
Oh hello, here's trouble. Hold the phone.

131
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:19,091
Who are you?
How you doing, big man?- All right, boss?

132
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,344
Are you well?
- Yeah, I'm fame...I'm fame...

133
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,812
Are you behaving yourself?
- Always.

134
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,549
I'm a teddy bear, me.
- Go easy.

135
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:27,422
If he gives you any trouble, come and speak to me. Come.
- Y'alright, mum?

136
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,552
Yeah, I'm good. She's good.- Hello, Reg.

137
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:36,431
Everybody here knows you.
- Yeah, well. It's my club.

138
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,594
You mean it's your local?
- No, I own this place. It's mine.

139
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,007
I've been by here ten times. I never knew it was yours

140
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,399
Well, you can get away with a lot in life
if you keep your mouth shut.

141
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,285
That's Teddy, now.

142
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:51,697
Hi, Teddy. How are you?
Good to see you. How's the family?

143
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,360
What?
- Those men are frightening.

144
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:59,721
No, no. They're just East End boxers. They're lovely.
I let 'em drink in here for free, y'know.

145
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:03,700
Reggie, that's Joan Collins.
- Yeah, it might be, yeah. We had

146
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:06,471
that...that...Barbara Windsor was in here the other night.

147
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,330
Really?
- Yeah, she comes in here quite a bit actually. She loves it.

148
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:15,279
And uh...That's my...my formula. What I like to do is mix celebrities
with a few, just a few, East End bitters.

149
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:19,315
Y'know, pugs, they love it. It's really good for business.
Would you like a seat?

150
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,776
Excuse me, Reg. Do you, uh, got a moment?
- No, I don't. That's it. I'm busy.
Alright?

151
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:27,031
It is important, Reg.
- This is important as well.
- Reg.

152
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:34,161
Alright, alright. Frances, would you mind
if I take care of some business just for a moment?

153
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:36,800
No, of course not.
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.

154
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:38,709
Sit with her.
What is it?

155
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,167
It's back here.
- What?

156
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:45,271
I'm a firm believer in the fact if you don't know,
you don't fucking know. Know what I mean?

157
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:51,973
Reggie.- How are you, Reg?

158
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:55,475
Well, I'm alright, I can't complain.
Who'd fucking listen?

159
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,236
What is the palaver?
- Sit down, Reg.
Sit down, please.

160
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:03,125
Alright.- You had a question about the taking of the purple art business.- Yeah.- The pill game.- Go on.

161
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,199
Jack here would like to explain himself.
- Go on.

162
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,618
Go on, Jack. Tell Reggie what you told me.

163
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:14,059
Well, Reg ...
- Yeah?

164
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:19,672
I, uh...thing is, under normal circumstances...my accountants...

165
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:23,716
Are you gonna take all fucking night, mate? Cuz
I've got things to do.

166
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,595
Tell him, Jack.
Go on, spit it out.

167
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,674
I borrowed a few quid off the top.
- Right, alright.

168
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,216
I swallowed a few pills on the side.- Yeah, there's a simple answer.

169
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:35,154
Things have been a bit ... tight at home

170
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,997
And I was...was just trying to keep the wife happy.- Trying to keep the wife happy.

171
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:41,400
Is this what you brought me in here? For this?- It's important.- This nonsense.

172
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:43,895
It's important business.
- It's important, is it?- Yeah.

173
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,789
You should know about this.
- Right, alright. Let's deal with this business.

174
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,441
Alright, tomorrow you come back to work, yeah?
and you pay back every fucking penny you owe.

175
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,170
Do you understand?
- I was gonna suggest that.

176
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:55,662
Good. Right. Are we done? Everybody happy?

177
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:01,459
Alright then. Can I get back to my fucking evening?
Thank you. Thank you very much, Albie.
Cheers.

178
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,382
Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.
- Thanks.

179
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:07,834
Thanks for coming in. Here you go, mate.

180
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:11,997
Good?

181
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:16,618
Fucking, thieving cunt. You understand...
- Get him a tissue.

182
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:21,378
*mumbles* with me? Yeah?
Next time I'll finish you off, you little slag.

183
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,816
Get him out of here. Go on, Fuck him off.- Fuck!

184
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,042
Are you fucking off. What did you say?

185
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:29,045
Don't you swear in my club.
Get him out of here right now.

186
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:31,740
Don't swear in my club, you wanker.

187
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:36,320
Now listen, there's something else.
- No, there isn't something else, alright, cuz I've got a young lady in here, and I'm entertaining.

188
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:37,946
Yeah, but this is ...
- Lookit.

189
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,561
See that, there?- I see it.- I'm entertaining. Alright?
So I'm gonna have an evening to myself.

190
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:44,476
This is important business.
- Can't be. My business, innit?

191
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,454
It's my business. I would know.

192
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,240
G'night, Albie.

193
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,329
Hello. Did I miss anything important?

194
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:57,973
No, just me.
- That? That is important.

195
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:00,143
Is it?
- Very important.

196
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,370
Thank you.- Thank you.
*mouths "Fuck off"*

197
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:11,878
So uh, your brother told me that you uh... you're going to college.

198
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:16,066
Right?  To...to study...to be a secretary. Is that right?

199
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,102
Yeah, anything to get out of the East End.
- Oh, what's so bad with the East End?

200
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:25,423
I've just got bigger dreams than pushing pram or having it with the butcher.

201
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,620
I just don't quite know what they are yet.
- East End is not that bad.

202
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,692
The center of the earth could be anywhere you like.

203
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:37,225
Even here?
- Yeah, even here.

204
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:39,836
In Bethnal Green?
- Yeah, in Bethnal Green.

205
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,865
Do you like being a gangster?

206
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:55,811
I'm not a gangster. I'm a club owner.

207
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,926
I like the money and I like the respect of being a club owner.

208
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,052
I'm not a gangster.

209
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:11,742
I could've been a boxer,
y'know, but then ya...hello, mate.

210
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,038
I'd end up looking like some sort of potato
and I wouldn't even know what day of the week it was.

211
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:19,041
This way at least I know who I am.

212
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,677
I also know that I've made a little bit of something of myself.

213
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:25,723
I don't owe the world anything.

214
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:29,435
So long as the world agrees with you.

215
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,762
I think the world will be alright.

216
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:48,985
<i> *Winston Churchill speaking* We shall fight on the beaches
. We shall fight on the landing grounds. </i>

217
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:52,865
<i> We shall fight in the fields
and in the streets. </i>

218
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:57,369
<i> We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. And if ... </i>

219
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,104
Ronnie.

220
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,998
Ronnie, come on out.
You've got visitors, mate.

221
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,963
Watch your step, it's a bit wet.

222
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,882
Cor, you alright?
- Mmm hmm.

223
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,641
You must be Frances.
-Hi.

224
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:24,234
Yeah? Hello, Frances. Hello. Welcome to the family.
Well, that is a bit premature, though, isn't it?
- *laughs nervously*

225
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:29,147
Hey, you don't have a beer that I can have, do ya, Ron?
- Yeah, of course I do, help yourself.

226
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,133
Right. Don't mind if I have a beer, do ya?

227
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,619
I'll let you get to know each other.

228
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:39,265
Want a cup of tea? I just put a kettle on. Take a seat. Go on.

229
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,603
Sit down anywhere you like.

230
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,201
Ey, needs a bit of warming up. So.

231
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,582
What do you think?

232
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:54,379
Do you think that we look alike? Me and Reggie
?- Oh yes, certainly.

233
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:58,803
No you don't. You think that he's beautiful and I've got a face like a gorilla's ass.

234
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,640
*laughs* No.
- It's alright, don't worry about it. I'm used to it.

235
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:07,580
<i> Stop doing your hair, right. Get your stuff
out of the car. Do something fucking useful. </i>

236
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,688
Go on, go away.

237
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:19,955
I'm a homosexual, Frances.

238
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,539
wel, you know, uh, I'm a giver, not a receiver.
There is a difference.

239
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,213
I'm not a faggot.

240
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:34,601
I do believe that, y'know, you should not hide what you are.

241
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:39,842
Not hide what you are,
because it makes you very sad, y'know? Very sad.

242
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:43,645
Make you very unwell.
- I agree completely.- Mmm hmm.

243
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:48,130
You know me and my brother? We're gonna rule London.

244
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,905
<i> The Kray's main rivals were the Richardsons of South London. </i>

245
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:58,023
<i> They were called the "Torture Gang '. </i>

246
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:01,134
For the benefit of the jury ...

247
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:05,406
On whose behalf were you operating on this side of the river?

248
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,209
Come on, Charlie. Please, I'm begging you...
- Oh, no no no no.

249
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:13,036
You do business with the court as an entity, therefore address the court.- What?- What?

250
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,415
Your honor.
- Fuck!

251
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,587
You say 'Your Honor'. By saying Your Honor, you gain the court's attention ...

252
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,882
and open up a channel of communication.
A conduit.

253
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,656
So, we'll try again.

254
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:30,361
For the benefit of the jury: On whose behalf were you working on this side of the river?

255
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,307
Please, Charlie. I fucking beg you...

256
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:37,426
Order! Order in this, my court.
- Oh, fuck!

257
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,172
You're in Indian Country, old son.

258
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:46,484
That's what them Cockneys call south of the river, innit?

259
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:49,247
Indian Country.

260
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:55,285
Well? What you doing on my reservation without my say-so ...

261
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,624
filling up your canteen from my fucking watering hole?

262
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,790
You ain't got the balls to do that on your own son.

263
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,993
Who do you work for?
- I don't know what you're on about, I don't know what you're on about, Charlie.

264
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,231
Say it. Say the name.
Say it!

265
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,579
Buzz him.

266
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,826
Objection, Your Honor.
My client is an outstanding citizen.

267
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:14,347
Objection overruled on the grounds it's boring.

268
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:15,780
Oh well, fuck him.

269
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:21,646
Say it.
Say the Krays, you daft cunt.

270
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,484
No, no. No leading the witnesses!

271
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,639
Get out.

272
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,259
Alexander was then great, but not Greek.

273
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:01,175
No?
- He came from Macedonia ?.

274
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:07,937
But he loved them. Aristotle and so.
He found the Hellenistic lazy impressive.

275
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:10,892
Kristos, get more of that awful Retsina.

276
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:24,997
Charlie, we have to solve this.

277
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:28,981
You're right.
Kristos, where is my Retsina?

278
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:32,629
<i> The Richardsons sent George Cornell
for a truce. </i>

279
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:35,403
<i> They said simply:
"Give peace a chance". </i>

280
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:36,925
Frank lets do it.

281
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,601
Are you suddenly become brave?
- We want a ceasefire.

282
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:44,724
I'll cut you to pieces.

283
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,683
Let him in, he is small.

284
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,146
It's getting out of hand.
Charlie wants to meet.

285
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,774
Pig and Whistle. Neutral ground.
Only he, the two of you and Eddie.

286
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,693
How do we know we will be safe?

287
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:03,406
That is a matter of trust, h ??

288
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:08,162
There is always someone one ??
which starts in confidence.

289
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:13,431
If you look back, you see another guy
with a cock in his hand ...

290
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:16,394
and he wants his dick as stabbing your ass.

291
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,712
That you would not mind.

292
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:21,707
Dirty fagot.

293
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:35,003
You, get him out of here. Piss off.
We'll be there in an hour.

294
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:38,575
Fuck off. The door is over there.

295
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:42,526
Take creep along.
- Fuck you, asshole.

296
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,105
Stupid idiot.

297
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:50,494
Can I get a new egg, Charlie?
I'm done with this.

298
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:52,496
I like this but nothing, Reggie.

299
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:57,132
It's OK?. I know them and the pub.

300
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,627
It will be fine.

301
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:02,698
You should clean the toilet,
it smells.

302
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:06,393
It's not my fault that the housekeeper
it does not. What do you want to drink?

303
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,259
Never mind, they just come inside.

304
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:14,348
Can I have two Guinness?
- Moment, just replace the barrel.

305
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:26,528
The Richardsons are prevented,
So we'll take care of you.

306
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:30,404
The bartender replaces the barrel already,
but thanks.

307
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,449
Is it bad if I inschenk something?

308
00:24:32,658 --> 00:24:36,385
What is that?
- What do you think? A weapon.

309
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:40,165
No, that's a rolling pin.
Are you sometimes Fanny Cradock?

310
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:45,169
Are you going to bake a cake for me?
Sing and watch me discharge my candles?

311
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:53,053
I come here for a gunfight
with real men.

312
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:56,640
As Colonel Custer and Geronimo.
Do you know them? Of course not.

313
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,352
Because you were too busy with cake baking, h ??

314
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:05,272
They're a bunch of sissies, Reg.
Really.

315
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:10,233
On the side, opzouten.
You call yourself a gangster?

316
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,536
A shootout is a shootout.

317
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,370
Just like a Western.

318
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:28,242
Idiots. What a letdown.
A goddamn waste of time.

319
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:36,550
Your brother has fled.
- He's just very disappointed.

320
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:43,641
Look, it's full of iron.
It takes a while before it comes to rest.

321
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:47,644
Charlie Richardson should we
you fully assembled rams, Reg.

322
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,691
Really? How kind of him. Listen.

323
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,276
If you see him again,
tell him I said:

324
00:25:56,445 --> 00:26:00,072
Charlie can get the Fuck
and his brother also.

325
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,951
And those dikzak Georgie Cornell
who deals with him.

326
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,206
You can also get the Fuck.

327
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,748
And the rest of it,
What do you think of that?

328
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,291
Like what?

329
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,871
Do you mind if I fight back?
- Can you handle it then?

330
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:20,844
It's more for my own pride.
I warn you that I do not fight fair.

331
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:23,478
That's why I brought it.

332
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:27,558
Before we begin, I want to tell a joke.
You will find this amazing.

333
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:30,793
A man with paranoid schizophrenia
comes into a bar ...

334
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:02,459
Assholes.

335
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:21,285
<i> They had no chance against my handsome Reggie. </i>

336
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,990
<i> A gang war seemed a certainty. </i>
- Damn it, Ron.

337
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:30,108
<i> But during the World Cup final,
interfered with Scotland Yard also undertaken. </i>

338
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,476
<i> There's Ball,
which runs from the lungs to the body. </i>

339
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:40,251
Come on, idiots.

340
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,300
Police, stay where you are.
- Come on, not today. Why not a goal?

341
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,718
Wait.

342
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:54,264
It is a goal.

343
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:05,635
<i> Charlie Richardson got 25 years in prison
fraud, extortion and assault. </i>

344
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:10,195
<i> London was an open city
and the Krays seized their chance. </i>

345
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,381
Glad you could come, Mr. De Faye.

346
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,199
Mr. Payne.

347
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:29,381
I'm not easily ge? Intrigued,
but your message ...

348
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:31,343
was intriguing.

349
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,633
Sit down.

350
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,765
This is the Kray twins.

351
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:40,599
Ronald and Reginald.

352
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:48,759
I've heard of them.
- They are useful friends.

353
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:55,572
What is this about, Mr. Payne?
- A casino in Knightsbridge, Esmeralda's Barn.

354
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:57,700
I do not know it.
- Really?

355
00:28:58,032 --> 00:29:04,082
You will be surprised that you have ?24,000
to have earned over the past three months.

356
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:09,379
My friends and I would like to buy it.
The contract is ready to sign.

357
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:15,672
<i> In order to rule over London,
intelligence and intimidation was necessary. </i>

358
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,310
It's not for sale.

359
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:23,348
In the future this will probably
not go so polite.

360
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:29,053
<i> The trick was to create a quiet certainty? Run.
That violence is always an option, if needed ... </i>

361
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,780
<i>, and the like will be used. </i>

362
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,191
<i> Leslie Payne was a swindler and fixer. </i>

363
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,487
<i> Reggie Payne found useful,
but Ron was suspicious. </i>

364
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:43,783
<i> He was afraid that his scam
did not fit the life of a gangster. </i>

365
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:46,278
Consider Las Vegas.

366
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:49,248
It is legal and is run by the mafia.

367
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:53,376
London is the same soon.
Havana is now gone, the mob is coming.

368
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:57,813
Meyer Lansky has already made inquiries.
- Meyer Lansky?

369
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,551
The real Meyer Lansky?

370
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:02,300
Meyer Lansky.

371
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:06,749
Americans want our silence?
- They will not have to work.

372
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:10,224
They do not want war, Ron.
They are businessmen.

373
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:11,893
Maybe I do want war.

374
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:17,122
They want to know who the new
promising local company is.

375
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,746
They colonize London by that company
finance and roll out a franchise.

376
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,650
Prove to the Americans,
the Krays the only gang in the city.

377
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,840
Interestingly though.

378
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:32,036
The world can be ours.
- Payne.

379
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,168
You say quite often "us".

380
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:41,798
You say 'us' and 'we' tell you much.

381
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:43,591
Is that right?

382
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,511
Is your last name sometimes Kray?

383
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:54,149
You can keep the beautiful things, Ron.
I'll take the rest.

384
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:58,189
I'd like to believe that.

385
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:03,843
Reggie, I think it's a bad idea.

386
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:07,922
I think we bastards from the mafia
should meet at the airport.

387
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,995
We pick them up, murder them
and send them in their own luggage home.

388
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:15,662
Now that's a plan.

389
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,184
I am pleased with this meeting.

390
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:31,535
Mr. Lansky is ge Interested
in the Colony Sporting Club.

391
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:34,147
His casino people are there now.

392
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:40,518
Mr. Lansky would like to know,
we have a casino.

393
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:43,471
Really? Your own casino?

394
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,527
Las Vegas is our property.

395
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:50,808
But here's the Atlantic
us in the way.

396
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:56,577
So Mr. Lansky can be owned
not physically secure.

397
00:31:56,845 --> 00:32:00,015
Both against outsiders as the police.

398
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:05,448
He thinks the Kray family can help.
London is the Las Vegas of Europe.

399
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:09,354
We need someone who does our business
and fighting for us.

400
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:17,059
We can provide you security,
but we do not want to work for you.

401
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,164
We prefer to cooperate.

402
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:25,073
What Reggie to say ...
- That he knows best. He said the net.

403
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:30,417
We are on your site.
Mr. Lansky would like best about discussi? Run.

404
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:36,042
He sends this as a gesture of good will.
As a taster. Open it, please.

405
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:48,411
In the second case are matters
I have to handle myself.

406
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:54,141
Bonds. Free money.

407
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:58,857
$ 100,000 in bonds
stolen from a bank in Montreal.

408
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:01,813
We can not lose in North America.

409
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:06,742
It is $ 100,000.
Can you handle that?

410
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,524
We can to do that.

411
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,244
Really? Beautiful.

412
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:18,846
Boys who commit robberies get 20%.
We share the rest 60/40.

413
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:24,038
If this goes well, Reggie,
I lie still two million in bonds.

414
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,105
Does that sound as if you stay in our neighborhood?

415
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:33,607
50/50, friend.

416
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:43,011
I like you, Reggie.
50/50, agreed.

417
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:47,418
I am pleased that we have closed a deal.
This feels good.

418
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:50,442
Come to Philadelphia ...

419
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:54,512
and if you see something you like,
You can get that from us.

420
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:57,962
An Italian girl
or spaghetti with meatball.

421
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:00,207
I prefer boys.

422
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:04,065
Sorry, I did not hear you.

423
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:09,674
I said I'd rather have boys.
Ideally Italians.

424
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:16,294
Sometimes Greeks, but I'm not biased.
I have actually ever had a Negro.

425
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:21,434
And someone from Tahiti, which I in the creases
have worked. I made him real pain.

426
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:33,570
You have guts you relent.
You really have balls.

427
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:38,839
You know what I say?
Bravos and cheers. Am I right or not?

428
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,142
On balls, cheers.

429
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:47,978
Well done.
- Cheers.

430
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:55,759
<i> You do not understand.
He's not what you think. </i>

431
00:34:55,823 --> 00:34:59,373
<i> He is very sweet
and it is exciting to be with him. </i>

432
00:34:59,537 --> 00:35:02,170
<i> I do not have such a boring life if you do. </i>

433
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:06,261
<i> I have a boring life,
because I sacrificed it for you. </i>

434
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:20,240
Frankie, you deprive me of my breath.

435
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:22,996
You can have mine.

436
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,643
You're a joke dress.
Sit in the car.

437
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,777
Hurry up.

438
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:51,143
<i> Esmeralda's Barn was very profitable.
?2,000 pure profit per week. </i>

439
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,640
<i> We could just enjoy it. </i>

440
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,745
<i> That casino was all for Reggie. </i>

441
00:35:57,009 --> 00:36:02,310
<i> He had finally crossed the border
between the old East End and Golden West. </i>

442
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:05,066
<i> He was a celebrity. </i>

443
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:10,183
<i> As long as their health permitted,
the rich were happy with gangsters. </i>

444
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:14,582
<i> Aristocrats and criminals
have much in common. </i>

445
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:17,986
<i> Both are selfish,
bored quickly ... </i>

446
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:21,834
<i> and have access to money,
where they have never worked honestly for. </i>

447
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:27,560
<i> The best?
Both of them do not care about morality of the rules. </i>

448
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:33,077
<i> Put in a roulette wheel at
and you have the key to success. </i>

449
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:37,328
<i> Ron was the odd man out. </i>

450
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:40,790
<i> Through his pills he was stable,
but he would never recover. </i>

451
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,769
<i> He did not like the club life ... </i>

452
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:46,559
<i> and he longed for Reggie
and the dark side of the gangster life. </i>

453
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:50,634
As soon as you turn your back ...

454
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:55,398
life playing dirty games.

455
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:16,810
<i> We were not together at Christmas that year. </i>

456
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,983
<i> There was an old warrant against Reggie. </i>

457
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:24,290
<i> He appealed for the last six months
his sentence, but this was rejected. </i>

458
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:26,866
<i> He had to morning vomit. </i>

459
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,334
<i> My real life was about to begin at the point. </i>

460
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,505
See you later.

461
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,051
Until later, Reg.
- Bye.

462
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:34,595
Frank.

463
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,403
Would you watch your sister when I'm gone?
- I will, Reg.

464
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:42,492
Well done.

465
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,206
Hurry up, Kray.

466
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,670
Stop on the line.

467
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,216
You are nothing.

468
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,554
Beat him.

469
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:21,557
Beat him up.

470
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,276
<i> Leave him alone, Gibbsy.
- Kill him, Reggie </i>.

471
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:30,572
Shut up, everyone.

472
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:34,831
<i> Come on, Reg.
- Do not do this </i>.

473
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:37,110
You're not so tough anymore, h ??

474
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,599
<i> Make that bastard off. </i>

475
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,182
You are nothing.

476
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:50,021
Nothing.
- Stop, please.

477
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,663
That's better, Reggie.

478
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:58,535
A little respect can not hurt?

479
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:00,875
Stop.

480
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,543
I have turned bigger turds.

481
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:07,193
Water, please.
- You want some water?

482
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:10,523
Look at that, gentlemen.
He begs for water.

483
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:14,572
What do you now
the famous Reggie Kray?

484
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:19,490
Begging for water.
What has become of him?

485
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:24,831
Please, Reg. Not spill.
You're a little shaky, do not you?

486
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,335
Here.

487
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:31,425
Well done.

488
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:37,260
There he is.
Reggie Kray, begging for water.

489
00:41:04,937 --> 00:41:06,524
Hello, Frances.

490
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:09,837
Hi, Ron.
- I've seen Reg today.

491
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:14,373
He says hello
and says he still should not visit.

492
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,750
Did he say why?
- No.

493
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:26,393
Did you know that it is possible
to become a ghost while you're still alive?

494
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,853
Do you think?

495
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:31,481
You're talking about is?

496
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,050
No, listen.
- No, what?

497
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,878
Just listen, please.

498
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:48,261
Casinos are required by law
to pay out prizes right away.

499
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:52,224
Therefore, the gamblers have their debts
immediately repay. It's simple.

500
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:58,570
I heard you,
but that's your problem and not mine.

501
00:41:58,735 --> 00:42:01,808
My problem is that I want ?50,000.

502
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,139
Now you start again about ?50,000
to go to Nigeria.

503
00:42:05,165 --> 00:42:10,422
It is not just to go to Nigeria.
I want to start a business.

504
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,014
I want a city for children
building in Nigeria.

505
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:18,945
Near Enugu.
- Enugu, yes.

506
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:23,544
I said Enugu.
You do not know anything, either, Payne?

507
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:27,019
Did you know that "Enugu"
the African word for 'Utopia' is?

508
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:28,344
No.
- Not so.

509
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:31,619
Did you know that 'Utopia'
the Greek word for 'nowhere' is?

510
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:34,839
With ?50,000 can I 'somewhere' out of it.

511
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:39,222
I can make a spot of there
where people laugh at me and dancing children.

512
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:41,490
I laugh so much for you, Ron.

513
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:45,934
I do that, when you tell me
I going to get ?50,000.

514
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:49,312
I'm telling you, take it out of the casino.

515
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:53,293
I can not do that.
- Get it out of the casino, asshole.

516
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:58,254
Do not mess with a legal, profitable business.
- I am not a banker.

517
00:42:58,418 --> 00:43:04,689
I am not a banker.
- Brilliant, that's much better.

518
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,697
This is a man who wants to build a city.
- Not threaten me, asshole.

519
00:43:07,722 --> 00:43:10,859
do not you dare
to speak to me, asshole.

520
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:15,991
Reggie is not there. He is gone.

521
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:18,980
You work for me, Ron Kray.

522
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:25,324
So you go to the bank
and takes anywhere from ?50,000.

523
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:27,995
I'll go to the bank
and see what I can do.

524
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:33,937
I might work for you, Ron,
but I'm not afraid of you.

525
00:43:35,187 --> 00:43:38,192
Then you are also stupid,
for that you have to be.

526
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,307
If my brother had not vouch for you,
you were dead.

527
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,056
What happened?

528
00:44:12,594 --> 00:44:16,224
What are you doing here?
Said Ronnie not want you to stay away?

529
00:44:18,844 --> 00:44:20,098
I missed you.

530
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,938
Frankie, I do not want me here like this.
Do you understand?

531
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,402
Who did that?
- What?

532
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:30,487
Your face.
Was it another inmate?

533
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:34,313
No, it was a jailer.

534
00:44:34,578 --> 00:44:36,541
Have you given them?
- No.

535
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:43,092
If I'm free, I'll talk to the prime minister.
Who listens well.

536
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,014
Frankie, it's the prison.
That's just the way.

537
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,186
The laws of the jungle apply here.

538
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:54,110
But I'm a big boy
and can take care of myself. I'm pretty soon.

539
00:44:54,411 --> 00:44:58,409
Look at that big guy there.
With that big hat.

540
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:02,336
We call him for a reason 'sissy'.

541
00:45:08,218 --> 00:45:09,844
I do not want this life.

542
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:15,730
Wait for you while you're stuck.
- I know that.

543
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,200
Frankie, it will not happen again.

544
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:24,329
How do you know that?
- Because I know.

545
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:28,295
Because I promise you
that it will not happen again.

546
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:32,618
I know how you can know for sure.
- Tell.

547
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,313
You can go on the right path.

548
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:39,194
Be the owner of a casino or club.
Do you like it.

549
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,148
Forget the rest.

550
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:45,889
It really is that simple for you, h ??
"Get on the right path."

551
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:51,967
Life is not always
as we want, sweetheart.

552
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:55,488
Life has other plans.
So that way it is.

553
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:56,772
I love you.

554
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:01,014
I love you.

555
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,718
I've never loved anyone,
but I love you, Reggie.

556
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:12,749
I love you too.

557
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:22,758
Do you think it can protect people?
- What?

558
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:24,477
Love.

559
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,863
I think he's right. He has something.

560
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:34,213
You know what I think it is?
His hips.

561
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:37,711
I want to enjoy blowing on the trumpet.

562
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:40,988
Are you horny, Ron?

563
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,723
That's right.

564
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:49,310
Do it.
- I will. I want to blow the trumpet.

565
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:51,734
I am going to do it.

566
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:07,332
All right, Ron. Bladder but tasty.

567
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:19,128
Stop it.

568
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,194
Hey?
- Hello, Ron.

569
00:47:35,263 --> 00:47:38,392
You know when I plan
to die?

570
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,086
When, Ron?

571
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:42,242
If the latest deal is closed.

572
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:47,074
Encourage him not to damn it.

573
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:51,598
Look at you now rich people sit down.

574
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:59,587
I may not be so good,
but a good gangster?

575
00:48:00,056 --> 00:48:05,857
I like to claim that title.
How many titles can you claim?

576
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,195
Superficial lazy.

577
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:15,081
It is thus thrown into your lap.

578
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:21,592
It's disgusting, really.

579
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:25,591
A little magic then, which do you like.
Every child loves magic.

580
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:32,642
You know that there are three times the letter 'K'
in the word "cooking" occurs.

581
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,564
But how many K's ...

582
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,788
are there in the word "asshole"?

583
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,840
Your ankle.

584
00:49:11,006 --> 00:49:12,307
You're free.

585
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:18,567
Why are you throwing stones at the window?
- They are not stones but Lemon sherberts.

586
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:19,961
Please.

587
00:49:21,022 --> 00:49:22,665
Good catch.

588
00:49:23,287 --> 00:49:26,740
Why do not you call it?
- By your mother.

589
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:31,973
The idea that your mother
the door would open, is creepy.

590
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:34,445
They will tackle me hard
to have been where I am.

591
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,583
You mean prison?
- Exactly. You look beautiful.

592
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:40,479
You too.

593
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:45,532
I know it's late,
but I got your Christmas present here.

594
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,759
Should I throw it up?
- No.

595
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:51,506
Should I deliver it?
I do not by that door.

596
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,400
Good.

597
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:57,583
Hussy.

598
00:50:02,183 --> 00:50:03,425
Careful.

599
00:50:05,204 --> 00:50:07,332
Little late, is not it?

600
00:50:09,664 --> 00:50:12,084
Your flowers.
- Thank you.

601
00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:14,372
And...

602
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:17,926
your Christmas present.

603
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,070
Sorry it's so late.

604
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,512
Open it.

605
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,687
Frances Shea, will you marry me?

606
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,849
We are living free and legal?

607
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:40,271
I swear.

608
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:46,157
Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.

609
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:55,048
Which was not mine.

610
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,144
Brutal.

611
00:51:02,613 --> 00:51:04,090
If so.

612
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:11,582
Show me your ass, that is.
- You do not listen.

613
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,134
I only say that the crime
still is a business.

614
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:20,119
There is a PR department needed
and we have Joseph Goebbels.

615
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,375
Is he fat?

616
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:24,779
You can read lips.
What he says, Les?

617
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:29,948
He talks to me
about hoops or domes?

618
00:51:31,493 --> 00:51:32,870
That's weird.

619
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:36,374
You're not happy.
You will see it.

620
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,669
Nice is not it?

621
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,396
He looks good, Ron.
He has grown some muscle.

622
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:53,471
He will be upset.

623
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,609
Did I miss something?

624
00:51:57,226 --> 00:52:01,270
Is not Friday night?
- I tried to tell you.

625
00:52:01,438 --> 00:52:04,902
But it's Friday?
You did not think it was so bad.

626
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:10,423
It's because of Ron. He has ruined the company.
He has made a financial wreck it.

627
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:14,868
And the company will go bankrupt
if we have to pay taxes.

628
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,078
What is he saying?

629
00:52:17,746 --> 00:52:22,167
You paid no tax, the idiot.

630
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,588
We go.

631
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:30,583
This morning we act out, understand?

632
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:33,009
How rude.

633
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:39,808
Where are you going?
- This is criminal.

634
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:43,980
Where are you going?

635
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:50,987
There's my handsome brother, Reggie.

636
00:52:51,155 --> 00:52:53,533
A toast to my handsome brother.

637
00:52:53,557 --> 00:52:58,033
Finally home, like Agamemnon's return
to Ithaca.

638
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:04,376
And beautiful Frances, where were you?
It's like being resurrected from the dead.

639
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:07,042
What are you doing?
What kind of game do you play?

640
00:53:07,879 --> 00:53:11,567
I do not play games, you can.
You do not even greet me.

641
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:15,887
We do not drink and you just go away.
- All right. Hi, Ron. Thanks.

642
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:18,037
Fuck you.
- Why are you yelling?

643
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,283
You had the world at your feet ...

644
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:23,177
but you could not deal with it,
So did you just fucked up.

645
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,619
You were gone.

646
00:53:24,687 --> 00:53:27,270
I was stuck.
- I had to make do with what I had.

647
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:29,608
Do you go for Ron and Reg?

648
00:53:30,902 --> 00:53:32,403
To bet?

649
00:53:33,236 --> 00:53:36,255
Reginald. He does not lose
in front of his girlfriend.

650
00:53:36,323 --> 00:53:38,665
You had everything.
- Jou not.

651
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:42,261
Unbelievable. I'll handle this off.
It'll be fine.

652
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:46,525
He can handle it, it's a big boy.
We're talking about business.

653
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:50,921
We are talking about gangsters, because we are.
So you can fuck off.

654
00:53:50,985 --> 00:53:52,230
Get out.
- Do not.

655
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:56,715
Someday you by your terrible life
be engulfed, Ron Kray.

656
00:53:57,383 --> 00:54:01,403
You should know.
I've heard all the horror stories.

657
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:05,828
Your mother gave us damaged goods, h ??
And you're damaged, right?

658
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:08,916
Go to the car.
You never talk anymore at Frances.

659
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:13,491
For example, is that, Frances. Blood is thicker than water.
I've been with Reggie together since the womb.

660
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,838
Shut up, Ron.
Frances offer your apologies.

661
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:21,115
All right, Frances.

662
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:23,661
I'm sorry, okay?

663
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:29,166
Very. The club is rather empty.
A bit like you.

664
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:32,054
There is not much in,
outside the dick of my brother.

665
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:54,275
You are a disgrace.

666
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,487
You hit me.

667
00:55:07,812 --> 00:55:09,097
No, Ron.

668
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,569
Now you have done it, asshole.

669
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,465
Asshole.

670
00:55:24,796 --> 00:55:26,807
Not the bottle.

671
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:34,106
Not my balls.

672
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,049
Idiot.

673
00:55:41,693 --> 00:55:43,739
Please go away, darling.

674
00:55:44,572 --> 00:55:46,525
Dirty Bastard.

675
00:55:57,252 --> 00:55:58,630
Give me that.

676
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:06,385
You should not sit on someone's balls.

677
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:12,431
What are you doing?
No, Ron. That is a bottle.

678
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:27,238
I pull them apart.
- No, stay seated.

679
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:31,370
It's family.
Give them space.

680
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:34,488
Beat him down.

681
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:42,088
I told you.
- It's enough like this.

682
00:56:46,092 --> 00:56:47,385
No.

683
00:56:52,098 --> 00:56:53,932
Enough, Reg.

684
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:56,642
You do not understand.

685
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:04,566
You do not understand me.
- Because I do not want to understand, Ron.

686
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:10,888
I just wanted ...
- It is useless to explain.

687
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:17,615
It's hopeless. Help me up.
It was painful.

688
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:20,958
What are you doing? Damn it, Ron.

689
00:57:21,026 --> 00:57:26,839
What I'm trying to tell you is simple.
Listen to me.

690
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,259
I am very ...

691
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:34,723
fragile, ok ??

692
00:57:34,888 --> 00:57:36,405
Fragile, understood.

693
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:39,300
Fragile.
- I understand.

694
00:57:48,693 --> 00:57:50,154
Hurry up.

695
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:53,065
I'm not myself, do you?

696
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:55,115
This is not me, is it?

697
00:57:55,283 --> 00:57:58,246
So we are not.

698
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:02,751
I am very sorry.
- It is well.

699
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:04,585
Are you done?

700
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:07,043
Is she gone?

701
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,504
Yes, she's gone.

702
00:58:08,673 --> 00:58:09,922
I would love her.

703
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,340
Thanks, Ron.

704
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:26,774
There she is.
- I see her.

705
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,608
Ok ?, stop here.

706
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:32,067
She'll be mad at me.

707
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:33,613
Go ahead.

708
00:58:34,197 --> 00:58:37,156
Frankie. Frank.
Sorry.

709
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:41,169
Can I talk to you?
- I do not care if you forget me.

710
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:42,830
Do not say that.
- It's true.

711
00:58:42,998 --> 00:58:45,984
You're kidding me.
- Do not tell me what I mean. I know what I mean.

712
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,335
Come on, Frances.
Can we start over?

713
00:58:48,503 --> 00:58:52,007
From the beginning.
We can leave out all the bad ...

714
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:53,756
and everything is tightly.

715
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,720
And then Ron?
- What about Ron?

716
00:58:58,261 --> 00:59:02,725
He is not exactly a good thing, do you?
- But he's not really bad.

717
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:06,393
He was horrible to me yesterday.
- That he was, but that's Ron.

718
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:11,318
If he does not take his pills, he does.
He is a nightmare.

719
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,084
He is not always so.
He has a heart of gold.

720
00:59:14,152 --> 00:59:15,902
He loves you, he thinks you're wonderful.

721
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,780
When you left, he was devastated.

722
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:20,158
He said: "Where did she go?"
I said, "She's gone."

723
00:59:20,326 --> 00:59:22,785
Go after, you should keep her.

724
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:26,833
You're here to stay, he's right.
Tell her I'm sorry.

725
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,498
He regrets, and me too.

726
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:30,416
Sorry all.
But you know what?

727
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:33,503
It sometimes just happens.
Families are stupid, right?

728
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:35,757
They ruzi? N and make amends.

729
00:59:35,922 --> 00:59:39,593
And eventually they stay together
because they love each other.

730
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:41,303
That's what they do.

731
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:45,891
Do not say I remember you,
because that will not happen.

732
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:48,186
I think the last six months of life to you.

733
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,604
I come out and the club's a mess ...

734
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:52,982
Sorry.

735
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:54,708
OK?.

736
00:59:54,776 --> 00:59:59,364
<i> It was time for the Krays to the secret
entering history of the 60's. </i>

737
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:05,030
<i> How absurd it seems ... </i>

738
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,827
<i> it became Ron's dream in which he
"builds n utopian city in Nigeria. </i>

739
01:00:11,368 --> 01:00:13,538
Some are born to be Ronnie Kray ...

740
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:17,919
and some to be Ronnie Krays confidant.

741
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:23,172
<i> Lord Boothby was a distinguished member
House of Lords. </i>

742
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,634
Ronnie.
- Yes?

743
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:28,721
I regret that I must decline.

744
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:32,472
Nigeria is simply too far away ...

745
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:37,061
and I'm no relationship with anything
I can not personally verify.

746
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,811
Sorry.

747
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:45,317
He's really nice, is not it?

748
01:00:47,363 --> 01:00:49,448
I assume you want ice and a slice, sir?

749
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:51,783
Ice and a slice.

750
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:53,492
Please teddy bear.

751
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,995
And like a little fast.

752
01:00:58,205 --> 01:01:02,084
Do you know where I heard
that lemons are particularly tasty and fresh?

753
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:04,379
No. True?

754
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:06,673
In Enugu in Nigeria.

755
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:09,007
You're good you? Informed, Teddy.

756
01:01:09,592 --> 01:01:11,593
Very good you? Informed.

757
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:13,764
Ad fundum.

758
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:17,347
Do you like the ad fundum, Teddy?

759
01:01:18,392 --> 01:01:21,227
Boothby hit down the offer,
but the friendship was formed.

760
01:01:21,435 --> 01:01:24,690
And Perrin was a quick guest
in one apartment of Ron.

761
01:01:24,854 --> 01:01:27,777
The ripple would spread far and wide.

762
01:01:28,149 --> 01:01:30,235
Call me later, Tom.

763
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,613
Harry, all alone?

764
01:01:32,782 --> 01:01:35,364
It is not necessary,
there is plenty of fruit on the tree.

765
01:01:35,532 --> 01:01:39,076
Tom, not in the House of Commons tonight?

766
01:01:39,744 --> 01:01:41,162
Yes.

767
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,580
Look at me, asshole.

768
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:45,474
Yes?

769
01:01:46,543 --> 01:01:49,005
Now look at him.

770
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:51,463
Look at me, damn it.

771
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:55,551
Look at me.

772
01:01:59,263 --> 01:02:01,641
Good heavens, that's Bob Boothby.

773
01:02:01,933 --> 01:02:03,311
Yes, Prime Minister.

774
01:02:03,475 --> 01:02:04,892
That's an orgy.

775
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:08,439
They will find it difficult to explain this.

776
01:02:11,526 --> 01:02:12,775
Here.

777
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:17,156
Is that Tom Driberg?

778
01:02:17,324 --> 01:02:18,573
Yes, sir.

779
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:22,493
There is no moral advantage for my party
if my party also is involved.

780
01:02:22,661 --> 01:02:24,411
Here it is what penibeler.

781
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,120
Where these pictures were taken?

782
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:27,541
Cazenove Road in Hackney.

783
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:31,253
What were they doing in Hackney?
- That's where it gets awkward.

784
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:34,048
I thought the orgy was awkward,
but it gets worse?

785
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:37,215
We had two brothers, gangsters, under guard.

786
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:38,844
The Krays.

787
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:41,763
The photos were taken in the apartment of Ron Kray.

788
01:02:42,348 --> 01:02:46,307
The orgy aside, we follow fraud
and criminal practices.

789
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:49,270
And the American mafia
There also might be involved.

790
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:52,898
London underworld had reached its peak.

791
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:54,359
Threatened a scandal.

792
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:56,609
The election is over ten weeks.

793
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,099
They will both sides
Voting out the parliament.

794
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,366
What exactly do you do about it?

795
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,075
Nothing, apparently.

796
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:07,788
Is that Italian?

797
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,289
I do not know.

798
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,955
Is it some Daimler?

799
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,458
No, that's not it.

800
01:03:14,626 --> 01:03:16,380
What do you want for Christmas?

801
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:21,801
I do not know. You have to give me anything.
You have to give me a gift.

802
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,928
That is ridiculous.
Give you nothing for Christmas?

803
01:03:25,096 --> 01:03:27,470
Surprise me then.
- I'll give you a sack of coal.

804
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:30,017
I think I'll give you a sack of coal.
Lucky.

805
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,682
And then?

806
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:33,476
What is it?

807
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:34,745
For Christmas.

808
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,187
For me?

809
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,109
This is my club.

810
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,111
Is that right?
- Yes.

811
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,655
West End, a touch of class.

812
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:48,034
This is our chance to get out of here.

813
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,702
It's snowing.

814
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,351
Away.

815
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,795
<i> What I wanted for Christmas? </i>

816
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,465
<i> My Reggie, free and orderly. </i>

817
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,008
<i> But Ron Reggie wanted to be back as well. </i>

818
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,638
<i> He longed for his gangster twins. </i>

819
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:12,849
<i> But Reggie chose the "Hide-a-way." </i>

820
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:21,357
<i> The owner was Hew McCowan,
son of a baronet. </i>

821
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,901
<i> Although he was not normally ge? intimidated
by the working class ... </i>

822
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,195
<i> he agreed,
to sell half of the club. </i>

823
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,680
<i> Reggie knew he rest
would get in due course. </i>

824
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,991
<i> An unfair deal for an honest life. </i>

825
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:35,371
<i> Ron was terrified
Reggie would leave him behind. </i>

826
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:37,836
<i> He sent Teddy to make the deal broke. </i>

827
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:39,206
I have talked to Reggie ...

828
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:41,877
I can not look at you, otherwise I'm lost.

829
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,263
I have an appointment with Reggie ...
- This tastes nasty.

830
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:46,421
I signed a contract.

831
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:48,799
I have a contract with Reggie, ask him.

832
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:50,841
Rubbish.
- Please.

833
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:52,635
I have customers.

834
01:04:52,803 --> 01:04:54,597
On the side. Come on.

835
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:56,431
I have customers, gentlemen, please.

836
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:57,700
I have talked to Reggie.

837
01:04:57,976 --> 01:05:01,267
We do not work for Reggie.
We work for Ronnie.

838
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,313
<i> Ron almost got what he wanted. </i>

839
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:06,440
<i> McCowan waived the deal,
but also called the police. </i>

840
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:09,275
<i> Reggie and Ron were both indicted
for extortion. </i>

841
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:12,069
I tell you, the police will come for me.

842
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:13,363
I am innocent.

843
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:15,280
Even if it is ...

844
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:16,618
What?

845
01:05:16,994 --> 01:05:18,667
You go back to jail.

846
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:20,722
You promised me something.

847
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:23,000
That still applies.
I am innocent, damn it.

848
01:05:26,251 --> 01:05:29,586
Sorry, I curse against you.

849
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:33,842
I want you to marry me.

850
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,053
Please.

851
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:43,559
If you're innocent and acquitted,
I'll marry you.

852
01:05:46,062 --> 01:05:49,313
If you're guilty, I want to see you again.
- Why do you say that?

853
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:50,606
Frankie, which ...

854
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:52,528
Frankie, really.

855
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,947
<i> Strangely enough, it was Lord Boothby
who saved. </i>

856
01:05:56,195 --> 01:05:59,406
<i> His wild excesses
had not gone unnoticed. </i>

857
01:06:01,036 --> 01:06:03,246
I have finally found her.

858
01:06:04,411 --> 01:06:07,250
She was sent to the right places.

859
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,668
Say: "Enugu".

860
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,670
Enugu.

861
01:06:12,963 --> 01:06:16,050
The photo was taken in Boothby's flat
in the newspapers go.

862
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:18,340
Along with the story of sexual misconduct ...

863
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:21,219
between a gangster and one member of the House of Lords.

864
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:25,515
The problem is that, unfortunately ...

865
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:28,061
This time all true.

866
01:06:28,226 --> 01:06:30,728
The truth does not interest me, Harold.

867
01:06:30,896 --> 01:06:33,691
Except that, the greater the truth ...

868
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,525
the greater the scandal.

869
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:37,234
The election was imminent.

870
01:06:37,402 --> 01:06:40,946
Therefore asked the Prime Minister Arnold Goodman
to solve the problem.

871
01:06:41,114 --> 01:06:44,077
Give me Cecil King of the Sunday Mirror.

872
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:48,205
The great and the good
took care of the concealment.

873
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:52,501
When defending the Krays
Boothby wanted to testify ...

874
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:54,166
the commitment was clear.

875
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:56,321
The government had dropped its case ...

876
01:06:56,376 --> 01:06:58,090
or face the consequences.

877
01:06:58,254 --> 01:07:01,841
This allows the Krays were the elusive
of the London underworld.

878
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:07,223
New information suggests the witness
the prosecutor, Mr. McCowan, in a bad light.

879
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:10,810
The case has been dismissed.

880
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:16,023
That evening celebrated the Krays
their victory in club McCown.

881
01:07:16,187 --> 01:07:18,609
Reggie had the same afternoon
The "Hide-a-way" bought.

882
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:20,651
With discount.

883
01:08:23,671 --> 01:08:24,772
Thank you.

884
01:09:17,971 --> 01:09:19,556
Why are you here?

885
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:24,601
I want the difference between you and me.

886
01:09:25,438 --> 01:09:27,187
The difference?

887
01:09:28,148 --> 01:09:29,441
OK?.

888
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:32,524
What you say about that.
- I grew up poor on ...

889
01:09:32,692 --> 01:09:34,110
just like you.

890
01:09:34,278 --> 01:09:36,448
As a boy I boxed, just like you.

891
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:40,116
But it did not change me into a thief.

892
01:09:42,454 --> 01:09:45,248
But it's you
turned into a cop, right?

893
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:47,623
Yes.

894
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:53,044
It changed you into someone
indicating his own people.

895
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:58,509
You know, the difference between us ...

896
01:09:58,801 --> 01:10:00,679
beyond the obvious ...

897
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:04,723
I work for myself.

898
01:10:05,223 --> 01:10:06,641
Do you ...

899
01:10:07,309 --> 01:10:09,059
You work for them.

900
01:10:24,073 --> 01:10:25,535
I can explain.

901
01:10:25,703 --> 01:10:27,913
This is Scotland Yard.

902
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:30,663
And this research is stopped immediately.

903
01:10:30,832 --> 01:10:36,629
But we can get so much more ...
- Your investigation into the Krays stops immediately.

904
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:20,587
She's wearing black.

905
01:11:20,755 --> 01:11:23,257
Yes I know. She misunderstood.

906
01:11:23,421 --> 01:11:25,180
She thought it was a funeral.

907
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:28,847
She wears black, that stupid bitch.
- I know. Do not let them get to you.

908
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:32,474
Wait till you see her daughter,
she looks amazing in white.

909
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,933
What do you see?

910
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:41,106
I see myself.

911
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:43,440
I see what I could be.

912
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:45,402
Do you know.

913
01:11:46,027 --> 01:11:49,614
If I was not so scared.
- You're not afraid of anything.

914
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,090
Right.

915
01:11:52,993 --> 01:11:55,119
Well, so much for myself.

916
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,374
And you.

917
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:03,980
What is she doing?

918
01:12:04,044 --> 01:12:06,006
You know what they'll say.

919
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:08,424
Take a deep breath.

920
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:13,137
Why are not you inside?
- Are you really sure you want to do this?

921
01:12:13,305 --> 01:12:15,723
Mom, do not start again.
- It's all right, Frank.

922
01:12:17,224 --> 01:12:18,394
I love him.

923
01:12:18,558 --> 01:12:19,727
Love.

924
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:23,815
Do you know what love is, Frances?

925
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:26,233
I know it does not answer anything.

926
01:12:27,318 --> 01:12:28,984
But love is a witness.

927
01:12:30,153 --> 01:12:31,694
Reggie sees me.

928
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:33,948
And I see him.

929
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:38,036
Who are you to reject it?

930
01:12:39,037 --> 01:12:40,663
I'm your mother.

931
01:12:46,336 --> 01:12:48,502
East End style, Frances.

932
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:49,811
That's you.

933
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:51,173
Thank you.

934
01:13:14,655 --> 01:13:17,029
Ron, you should see her.

935
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:20,701
She looks beautiful.

936
01:13:23,996 --> 01:13:25,097
Enjoy it.

937
01:13:31,463 --> 01:13:32,628
Merciful God ...

938
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:36,047
accept our prayers for Frances and Reginald ...

939
01:13:36,299 --> 01:13:38,970
that they may acquire the harvest of the Spirit ...

940
01:13:39,134 --> 01:13:43,054
and reflect your glory
in our Lord Jesus Christ.

941
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:45,600
Amen.

942
01:14:06,828 --> 01:14:08,246
Sing, damn it.

943
01:14:20,842 --> 01:14:22,675
<i> We went to Greece for our honeymoon. </i>

944
01:14:23,176 --> 01:14:26,971
<i> The Parthenon was already 2,400 years. </i>

945
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:30,391
<i> Reggie's promise to remain honest
held two weeks stand. </i>

946
01:14:31,808 --> 01:14:33,309
Two Aces ...

947
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,812
New Mill ...

948
01:14:36,312 --> 01:14:37,650
Gigi Club ...

949
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:39,527
not to mention Ronnie Scott's.

950
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:42,694
And this is the catch in Hamburg.

951
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,408
The kettles boiling.

952
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:50,410
It is tea.

953
01:14:51,246 --> 01:14:54,081
We started near Marble Arch in West London.

954
01:14:54,249 --> 01:14:56,251
But both we missed East End.

955
01:14:56,415 --> 01:14:59,418
That's why we took an empty apartment
in Rons Cedra Court.

956
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,465
Just like everything else in our lives
for it would be temporary.

957
01:15:03,338 --> 01:15:05,092
Not very smart.

958
01:15:06,593 --> 01:15:08,511
Rons parties kept me awake at night.

959
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:11,682
And club life kept Reggie
until the late hours away.

960
01:15:12,098 --> 01:15:17,479
He enjoyed it anyway 'n be gangster.
- We heard that you were last in the Regency.

961
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:22,108
You waved a gun.

962
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:28,153
The brothers Barry kept me going on inside.

963
01:15:29,282 --> 01:15:30,616
They said I was drunk.

964
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:33,410
That was you.
You were drunk.

965
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:34,952
And waved a gun.

966
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:40,086
No.

967
01:15:41,626 --> 01:15:43,628
You know that here was not gone.

968
01:15:43,796 --> 01:15:44,897
Not true?

969
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:48,048
You know that you were there on the balls.

970
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:50,602
I made it more interesting for people.

971
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:54,262
More interesting.

972
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:56,264
Please.

973
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:08,944
You do not do that again, do you?

974
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:10,902
No, sir.

975
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:12,840
Brave boy.

976
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,036
Damn.

977
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,038
Stand up.

978
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:21,372
This is so nice of you.

979
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,498
Strange, is not it?
- Indeed.

980
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:25,383
Hey.

981
01:16:31,465 --> 01:16:34,008
Is that OK??
- No.

982
01:16:34,176 --> 01:16:37,595
No, Frances, that's not good enough.

983
01:16:40,222 --> 01:16:42,684
Sit down with Mr. Kray,
I'll figure it out.

984
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:43,977
OK?.

985
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:54,487
She can not even
put a decent cup of tea.

986
01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:56,821
Poor Reggie.

987
01:16:58,115 --> 01:16:59,576
It was a good attempt.

988
01:17:01,662 --> 01:17:04,453
She's like a fool in that dress.

989
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:08,376
You would not pick her
as she lay in the gutter.

990
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:14,714
Poor Reggie.
Well ...

991
01:17:14,883 --> 01:17:15,984
I throw this away.

992
01:17:18,094 --> 01:17:19,887
<i> I left without saying goodbye. </i>

993
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:21,969
<i> A sad victory. </i>

994
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,100
<i> I would never be good enough for their Reggie. </i>

995
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:27,811
<i> He was also Nippers Reggie. </i>

996
01:17:28,688 --> 01:17:31,606
<i> Read did not rest
when he saw my husband ?? once a day. </i>

997
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,110
<i> I had to settle for the same. </i>

998
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:39,406
Wherever you go,
do not stop until you reach the sea.

999
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:41,616
<i> But we all need something. </i>

1000
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:45,075
<i> What I had in common with Ron
the pills were to get through the day. </i>

1001
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:49,287
<i> Sleeping pills sometimes helped,
other pills helped other times. </i>

1002
01:17:49,872 --> 01:17:52,126
<i> They were like a friend without judgment ... </i>

1003
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:54,460
<i>, and only wanted to be loved
in return. </i>

1004
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,794
<i> Mother's little helpers. </i>

1005
01:17:56,962 --> 01:17:58,964
<i> Their name was appropriate. </i>

1006
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:07,012
Do not go too fast.

1007
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,351
We're going far too fast.
We walk on the grass.

1008
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,437
Ok ?, we're almost there.

1009
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:13,895
OK?.
- A little further?

1010
01:18:16,565 --> 01:18:19,484
Ready? All done?
- Yes.

1011
01:18:21,237 --> 01:18:22,903
Oh my God.

1012
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,781
Do you like it?

1013
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:27,283
Yes, what is it kind?
What's it called?

1014
01:18:27,451 --> 01:18:30,494
It is a Triumph. A Triumph Spitfire.
- Can I be in it?

1015
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:34,250
Of course, it's yours.
Happy Birthday. Please.

1016
01:18:35,123 --> 01:18:37,877
Congratulations, Frances.
- Thank you.

1017
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:40,256
Would you take a ride with me?

1018
01:18:41,965 --> 01:18:43,090
I can do that.

1019
01:18:43,258 --> 01:18:46,762
Now?
- Not today.

1020
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:48,888
Why not?

1021
01:18:49,845 --> 01:18:51,847
I can not today.

1022
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:57,480
But I can tomorrow.
- OK?.

1023
01:18:57,644 --> 01:18:58,813
Sorry.

1024
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:09,382
Kray.

1025
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:11,717
Kray.

1026
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:17,099
There's an inherent threat
in that one syllable.

1027
01:19:17,267 --> 01:19:19,433
It is the only word
what some people need to hear.

1028
01:19:20,102 --> 01:19:22,352
What do you mean by 'the only word?

1029
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:25,023
You're just Ford.

1030
01:19:25,191 --> 01:19:26,400
Or Shell.

1031
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:28,318
Or Woolworth's.

1032
01:19:28,695 --> 01:19:32,907
Woolworth's.
Yes, that's very interesting.

1033
01:19:33,075 --> 01:19:36,579
I'm just saying Kray is a brand ...

1034
01:19:36,743 --> 01:19:40,956
and an established reputation
less maintenance, use less violence.

1035
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:43,334
The people comply.

1036
01:19:43,502 --> 01:19:45,837
Clubs have been asking for our protection
Before we get there.

1037
01:19:46,005 --> 01:19:48,964
That's true. They do that.

1038
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,927
Then we need them also to indicate less justified.

1039
01:19:52,095 --> 01:19:54,306
He is right.

1040
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,472
That makes sense.

1041
01:19:57,101 --> 01:19:59,227
You know what I like?

1042
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:01,770
Occasionally I like reprimanding nice.

1043
01:20:01,938 --> 01:20:04,024
Occasionally throw someone on the cobblestones.

1044
01:20:04,188 --> 01:20:05,442
Whats wrong with that?

1045
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:08,445
I think you can do better, Ron.

1046
01:20:09,193 --> 01:20:12,157
It keeps you out of jail.
We are not getting any younger.

1047
01:20:12,325 --> 01:20:14,575
You should leave this all behind you, you know?

1048
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,702
You have to look to the future,
you and your beautiful young woman.

1049
01:20:17,871 --> 01:20:19,665
Asshole.

1050
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:21,374
I am warning you.

1051
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:24,001
This is a company. That is a fact.

1052
01:20:24,169 --> 01:20:25,587
Are you okay? Can you see?

1053
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:28,133
I do not work for you. Stupid bastard.

1054
01:20:28,842 --> 01:20:30,592
Was excessive.

1055
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,096
I do not like him. I do not trust him.
He talks too much, ask too many questions.

1056
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:35,681
I want him dead.

1057
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:38,725
Leslie Payne is our business partner,
and you want him dead.

1058
01:20:38,893 --> 01:20:41,856
You've taken your pills?
- Fuck your pills.

1059
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:46,024
Fuck Payne,
the bastard with his damn briefcase.

1060
01:20:46,192 --> 01:20:49,528
It does not care what's in there,
I want to know what happens there.

1061
01:20:54,117 --> 01:20:56,996
He knows too many things.

1062
01:20:57,164 --> 01:21:00,415
Things about us.
He knows too much about us.

1063
01:21:00,584 --> 01:21:02,001
He knows too much about us?

1064
01:21:02,169 --> 01:21:04,712
Albie, you do know things about us?

1065
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,590
He knows things ...

1066
01:21:06,882 --> 01:21:09,133
Ron about me and about the company ...

1067
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:11,135
you know about the payments.

1068
01:21:11,303 --> 01:21:12,720
You know that we collect bonds.

1069
01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:16,224
You know we bribe juries
so they see us as benevolent.

1070
01:21:16,392 --> 01:21:17,573
Yes.

1071
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:21,522
You know, that's a surprise.
Jack, my friend, do you know anything about fraud?

1072
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:22,979
Whatever.

1073
01:21:23,147 --> 01:21:28,029
Do you know anything about how to bribe the police
every last Thursday of the month.

1074
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:30,155
Do you know?
- Yes of course.

1075
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:33,034
What a surprise, say.
Why do we murder Jack now?

1076
01:21:33,202 --> 01:21:36,037
Or Albie? All of them.

1077
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:38,916
I'll kill you and you to me,
then we're both dead.

1078
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,374
This is a genius idea.

1079
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:43,501
Listen to yourself, Ron.
You're awfully disturbed.

1080
01:21:48,258 --> 01:21:53,223
People who live in glass houses
should not throw stones.

1081
01:21:55,474 --> 01:21:58,501
Did you know I'd never drunk gin
before I came here?

1082
01:21:58,685 --> 01:22:01,604
Soon you sing 'God save the Queen' yet.

1083
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:05,860
What did you want to talk to me, Mr. Bruno?

1084
01:22:06,109 --> 01:22:08,820
Doing very well,
we are very happy on our side of the sea.

1085
01:22:09,156 --> 01:22:11,659
Which is good. We are also very happy.

1086
01:22:12,323 --> 01:22:13,617
OK?.

1087
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:15,202
Cheers.

1088
01:22:16,328 --> 01:22:17,537
Cheers.

1089
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:20,752
Do you realize that I asked to speak to you alone?

1090
01:22:22,086 --> 01:22:24,504
You see, in our line of work ...

1091
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:27,800
it is not good to be famous.

1092
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:30,635
Anonymity is the goal.

1093
01:22:32,929 --> 01:22:34,723
It is Mr. Lansky, Reg.

1094
01:22:35,139 --> 01:22:37,434
He sees a lot of potential in you.

1095
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:40,189
But your brother Ron sees limitations.

1096
01:22:40,605 --> 01:22:42,647
Maybe ...

1097
01:22:42,815 --> 01:22:44,693
they must meet.

1098
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:48,113
He must come for a chat.
- A talk?

1099
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:51,240
You guys are hilarious.

1100
01:22:52,826 --> 01:22:55,913
Have you ever heard of the Gallo brothers?
From Brooklyn?

1101
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:58,748
It was a similar situation.

1102
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,794
You see, Ron is your Joey.

1103
01:23:01,419 --> 01:23:03,962
And in both cases, it will not end properly.

1104
01:23:08,511 --> 01:23:11,346
What exactly do you ask of me, Mr. Bruno?

1105
01:23:12,347 --> 01:23:14,765
I ask you to do something about Ron.

1106
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,354
I can not do that.

1107
01:23:20,771 --> 01:23:22,397
He is my brother.

1108
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,029
Good.

1109
01:24:10,532 --> 01:24:11,677
I can not do anything.

1110
01:24:11,741 --> 01:24:12,950
I'm not done with you.

1111
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:16,706
Mr. Kray provides this warehouse.
- If you remember ?? n times Kray says ...

1112
01:24:18,164 --> 01:24:20,751
I will beat you, understand?

1113
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:24,423
I have an agreement with Mr. Kray.
- I did not ask you.

1114
01:24:24,591 --> 01:24:27,133
I asked if you understood me.

1115
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:29,636
<i> The Richardson gang was gone. </i>

1116
01:24:29,804 --> 01:24:34,141
<i> But George Cornell had crossed the river
to demand their 't protection money. </i>

1117
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:37,352
I fucking warned you.

1118
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,816
<i> Ron's reply would give him his place
in delivering the gangster legend. </i>

1119
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:44,820
Is this English breakfast tea?
- You can tell by your face what you think.

1120
01:24:44,984 --> 01:24:48,656
Beautiful box.
- It is not an English breakfast tea, no.

1121
01:24:49,033 --> 01:24:51,952
There are pheromones in.

1122
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,162
It is musky.

1123
01:24:54,414 --> 01:24:56,833
The best they make nowadays.

1124
01:24:57,706 --> 01:24:59,500
Really delicious, is not it?

1125
01:24:59,668 --> 01:25:02,379
I'm glad you like it.
- It does.

1126
01:25:02,755 --> 01:25:05,382
My mother will be very happy.

1127
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:10,219
Got this from the old warehouse?
Do not say anything, it's good.

1128
01:25:10,387 --> 01:25:12,681
Say hello to Mrs. Kray me.
- Thank you.

1129
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:13,991
And the other issue.

1130
01:25:14,059 --> 01:25:16,393
What issue?

1131
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:26,696
That?

1132
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,159
Well...

1133
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:33,455
Do not you think
that I will pay it, do you?

1134
01:25:37,123 --> 01:25:38,961
You can not handle it yourself?

1135
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:42,465
I pay you for protection, Ron.

1136
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:47,634
What is your point?

1137
01:25:48,259 --> 01:25:51,430
Nothing ...
- You said it.

1138
01:25:51,599 --> 01:25:54,642
You come here with that damn nose.

1139
01:25:55,559 --> 01:25:56,768
And your tea.

1140
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:59,062
Your exotic teas.

1141
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:01,901
Right? And you say this.

1142
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:04,360
I did not do my job.

1143
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:07,323
I did not mean it like that.
- That you did.

1144
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:09,618
No, I ...

1145
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:11,576
I'll tell you what.

1146
01:26:12,537 --> 01:26:14,539
This question of yours ...

1147
01:26:14,747 --> 01:26:18,167
I will for you to handle. OK??

1148
01:26:18,335 --> 01:26:23,925
Go along with Teddy
and bring me 2000 pounds, ok ??

1149
01:26:24,509 --> 01:26:29,763
In return, I promise
I let George Cornell murder.

1150
01:26:30,804 --> 01:26:32,057
Well?

1151
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:34,019
I did not ...
- Good?

1152
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:38,732
I said nothing about murder, Ron.
- You did damn well.

1153
01:26:39,233 --> 01:26:41,900
You meant it.
Look at me, you meant it with your eyes.

1154
01:26:42,068 --> 01:26:43,317
Look at your eyes.

1155
01:26:43,485 --> 01:26:45,571
I see it in your eyes.

1156
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,658
Are you threatening me?
- No.

1157
01:26:47,822 --> 01:26:50,116
For it is dead in your eyes
and you threaten me.

1158
01:26:50,284 --> 01:26:52,602
He threatening me?
- It's hard to say, Ron.

1159
01:26:52,622 --> 01:26:53,840
I'll pay it.
- What are you doing?

1160
01:26:53,904 --> 01:26:57,292
I'll pay it.
- Sure. A deal is a deal.

1161
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,561
It's done so.

1162
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,756
It is done. It's good.
Teddy, take him.

1163
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:03,923
Thank you.

1164
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:05,801
Very kind of you.

1165
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:08,219
Thanks for the tea.

1166
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:13,140
This is a good deal.

1167
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,443
<b> Blind Beggar </b>

1168
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:35,372
How do I look?

1169
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:37,959
Damn deadly.

1170
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:41,130
You want me to go in with it?

1171
01:27:42,255 --> 01:27:43,801
Inside.

1172
01:27:46,051 --> 01:27:47,429
Come on.

1173
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,264
You stay in the car.

1174
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:54,476
Is there anything I should know?

1175
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:03,654
Look who's here.

1176
01:28:04,615 --> 01:28:05,824
Jesus.

1177
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:12,331
Now do not laugh, h ??

1178
01:28:13,124 --> 01:28:15,206
Damn, that's sick.

1179
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,293
Boss, damn ...

1180
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,298
On the ground.

1181
01:28:23,843 --> 01:28:25,425
Shut up.

1182
01:28:25,593 --> 01:28:27,303
What are you looking at?

1183
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:29,057
You've seen nothing.

1184
01:28:34,895 --> 01:28:36,857
That's Ronnie Kray, right?

1185
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:38,482
Damn.

1186
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,234
Reggie.

1187
01:28:55,416 --> 01:28:57,250
Are you crazy?

1188
01:28:58,628 --> 01:29:00,297
The Blind Beggar? Cornell?

1189
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:03,008
It is on the radio.

1190
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:04,550
Reggie.

1191
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:06,988
Hi Mom.

1192
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:10,893
Please.
- Thank you.

1193
01:29:12,935 --> 01:29:14,120
Look at you now agree.

1194
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:17,692
Look how handsome you are.

1195
01:29:19,694 --> 01:29:22,153
I grab a cup of tea.
- Thanks, Mom.

1196
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:24,739
Albie?
- No, thank you, Violet.

1197
01:29:30,786 --> 01:29:32,580
You look good, Reg.

1198
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:38,085
How many witnesses?
- It was a quiet evening.

1199
01:29:38,254 --> 01:29:40,424
Seven.
- Seven?

1200
01:29:40,588 --> 01:29:42,005
Albert Woods was at Cornell.

1201
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:44,220
And a few regular customers.
I do not know them.

1202
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:47,723
And the barmaid, the blonde with the big eyes.

1203
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:49,073
Damn.

1204
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:51,852
And you bring it here, to your mother?

1205
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,896
Do not bother, it happened.
What are we going to do now?

1206
01:29:56,941 --> 01:29:58,815
'We'?

1207
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,367
Where's the gun?

1208
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:08,077
Here, Reg.

1209
01:30:11,164 --> 01:30:15,877
Please.
Want a piece of cake?

1210
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,796
That would be nice. Yes.
Thanks, Mom.

1211
01:30:18,964 --> 01:30:22,424
Yes, it is tasty.
- Thanks.

1212
01:30:24,634 --> 01:30:26,552
They've seen you in those clothes, right?

1213
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:30,100
Yes.
- Where's his jacket?

1214
01:30:31,057 --> 01:30:32,242
Which you need to burn.

1215
01:30:32,311 --> 01:30:34,773
The weapons we have to dump into the river.

1216
01:30:35,145 --> 01:30:36,523
Go now.

1217
01:30:43,154 --> 01:30:44,299
You're unbelievable.

1218
01:30:45,364 --> 01:30:49,453
Albie. We have to find out
who in the caf? sat.

1219
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:52,748
Approach them and uncover
what they told the police.

1220
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:55,503
It has to be negated.
Send Pat and Bender.

1221
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:56,960
That bartender I know anyway?
- Yes.

1222
01:30:57,129 --> 01:30:59,339
Bring her to me.
I'll talk to her.

1223
01:30:59,507 --> 01:31:00,925
Go ahead.

1224
01:31:03,219 --> 01:31:05,221
Where is everyone going?

1225
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,657
Mom, it's late.
I did not want them to bother you.

1226
01:31:08,692 --> 01:31:10,809
You should go to sleep so.

1227
01:31:10,935 --> 01:31:12,729
Shall I take you home? Come on.

1228
01:31:13,438 --> 01:31:15,480
No need, I'm home.

1229
01:31:16,525 --> 01:31:19,444
I have the bed made up for him.
He is not well.

1230
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:23,240
He has a fever.

1231
01:31:24,574 --> 01:31:26,408
He will remain here tonight.

1232
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:30,704
Teddy, you want to stay with him?

1233
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:35,918
That would be nice. Thank you, Violet.

1234
01:31:42,509 --> 01:31:44,511
What he has done ...

1235
01:31:46,136 --> 01:31:48,138
He's your brother.

1236
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,610
Yes.

1237
01:32:03,739 --> 01:32:05,701
Here are your pills.

1238
01:32:06,494 --> 01:32:08,496
You need to take them.

1239
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:14,042
I have to go.

1240
01:32:14,294 --> 01:32:16,212
The boys are still at work ...

1241
01:32:16,713 --> 01:32:18,298
and I have to clean up.

1242
01:32:19,171 --> 01:32:22,258
I must say good night.
- Good night.

1243
01:32:25,846 --> 01:32:29,102
Teddy, would you do us a favor?

1244
01:32:29,266 --> 01:32:31,144
When he takes off his pants tonight ...

1245
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:33,404
and his shirt,
make sure you burn them.

1246
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:35,024
Please contact me.

1247
01:32:35,188 --> 01:32:36,902
Good guy.

1248
01:32:38,151 --> 01:32:39,821
Good evening.

1249
01:32:39,985 --> 01:32:41,238
Good evening.

1250
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,286
He's nice, is not it?

1251
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:58,048
<i> Even Scotland Yard
murder on the street could not ignore. </i>

1252
01:32:58,212 --> 01:33:00,214
<i> Nipper again worked on the case. </i>

1253
01:33:00,383 --> 01:33:02,677
Gentlemen, your attention please.

1254
01:33:03,718 --> 01:33:07,722
You have been told
we carry out an important research ...

1255
01:33:07,891 --> 01:33:10,353
in a serious accusation of corruption.

1256
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:15,983
In fact, we go after the Krays.

1257
01:33:18,402 --> 01:33:22,530
Anyone can come to me with any objections.

1258
01:33:26,242 --> 01:33:28,620
See that post there?

1259
01:33:28,913 --> 01:33:31,668
That is known as one safety tip
during the war.

1260
01:33:31,832 --> 01:33:33,377
If you could walk to the post ...

1261
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:37,882
did you know you could reach the bunker
Before the bombs would fall.

1262
01:33:39,468 --> 01:33:43,889
One evening were Ron and I looked and there.

1263
01:33:44,513 --> 01:33:48,017
We saw Stanton House fly into pieces.
They were still inside.

1264
01:33:48,726 --> 01:33:50,560
It's a miracle you're alive.

1265
01:33:50,728 --> 01:33:53,354
Yes, especially Ron.

1266
01:33:53,523 --> 01:33:56,774
Every time there are problems
he drags them behind him.

1267
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,322
He has enough problems
if the stories are true.

1268
01:34:01,823 --> 01:34:03,826
I heard it on the street, Reggie.

1269
01:34:03,994 --> 01:34:06,536
My own family,
and you did not tell me.

1270
01:34:06,705 --> 01:34:09,371
I did not want you to worry.

1271
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,758
I'm not worried about Ron.
What are you going to do about it?

1272
01:34:12,793 --> 01:34:15,338
I do not let him go to prison.
- Why not?

1273
01:34:16,923 --> 01:34:19,174
Why not? Because he's my brother.

1274
01:34:19,342 --> 01:34:22,177
Even in prison he is still your brother.
- No.

1275
01:34:22,553 --> 01:34:25,224
No, Frances, he belongs here with us.

1276
01:34:25,388 --> 01:34:28,435
He belongs to you, me and his family.
This is his home.

1277
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,147
I care for him as he is free.
So it is.

1278
01:34:32,312 --> 01:34:34,650
In prison you can take care of him.

1279
01:34:35,275 --> 01:34:37,277
And he does not belong here, you know.

1280
01:34:38,278 --> 01:34:39,463
Right.

1281
01:34:41,113 --> 01:34:43,451
You just do not understand.

1282
01:34:43,868 --> 01:34:45,954
Yes.
- No, you're not.

1283
01:34:46,118 --> 01:34:50,206
You once said that your world was not guilty.
You're Ron also not guilty.

1284
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:54,379
My loyalty to my brother,
is my measure, you understand?

1285
01:34:54,547 --> 01:34:57,006
And your loyalty to me?
Is not that standard?

1286
01:34:58,675 --> 01:35:01,470
What could be wrong with your eyes?

1287
01:35:01,634 --> 01:35:02,888
Do you use something?

1288
01:35:03,056 --> 01:35:05,430
Did you take something, Frances?
Take your pills again?

1289
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:07,016
Let's see.

1290
01:35:07,184 --> 01:35:08,894
No, stop it.
- Hey, look at that.

1291
01:35:09,062 --> 01:35:11,521
Good God, Frances, how much is that thinking?

1292
01:35:11,773 --> 01:35:14,900
No wonder you do not understand.
You're addicted to pills.

1293
01:35:15,069 --> 01:35:17,301
That you've made of me.
- What? A pill swallower?

1294
01:35:19,573 --> 01:35:25,868
Let's be clear about what you say.
If we want to be free, we need to be alone?

1295
01:35:27,205 --> 01:35:29,956
Great, Frances.
I agree with that.

1296
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:33,168
Talk to the barmaid.

1297
01:35:33,336 --> 01:35:37,757
Tell her, as they draw the suspects,
she points to Ron and said, "That's him."

1298
01:35:37,925 --> 01:35:39,759
"That's the guy who did it."

1299
01:35:39,927 --> 01:35:41,096
OK??

1300
01:35:42,886 --> 01:35:45,224
Where are you going?
- Home.

1301
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:47,475
And my mother?

1302
01:35:47,643 --> 01:35:49,645
Which can be stolen.

1303
01:36:14,572 --> 01:36:16,406
Take your time.
- No.

1304
01:36:17,283 --> 01:36:19,409
The man who shot Cornell is not here.

1305
01:36:20,162 --> 01:36:21,579
Are you sure?

1306
01:36:21,747 --> 01:36:24,334
Yes, I'm sure.

1307
01:36:24,998 --> 01:36:27,253
Can somebody take me home?

1308
01:36:38,472 --> 01:36:39,681
Mrs.

1309
01:36:44,017 --> 01:36:48,566
I swear.
I smelled something but did not know what it was.

1310
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:51,317
But I caught a glimpse of the court.

1311
01:36:52,402 --> 01:36:54,236
The smell came from him.

1312
01:36:55,112 --> 01:36:56,866
Am I right or not?

1313
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:59,156
Am I wrong, Reg?

1314
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:01,719
It shows that you are a dog
a bad name can give ...

1315
01:37:01,787 --> 01:37:05,246
but when that hot dog Kray,
He can bite back. Well done, Ron.

1316
01:37:05,415 --> 01:37:07,625
Justice is satisfied.

1317
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:10,544
Welcome home.

1318
01:37:12,422 --> 01:37:13,631
On discipline.

1319
01:37:13,799 --> 01:37:15,593
Take one, Vi.
- No.

1320
01:37:15,757 --> 01:37:18,095
Give her the pink biscuits.

1321
01:37:20,346 --> 01:37:22,099
<i> Somebody has to eat them. </i>

1322
01:37:38,363 --> 01:37:39,865
What did you say to her?

1323
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:47,541
I told her to think of her children.

1324
01:37:50,752 --> 01:37:53,086
I wish I could disappear.

1325
01:37:54,047 --> 01:37:58,175
Good luck with that, Frances.
Damn luck with that.

1326
01:38:43,761 --> 01:38:45,723
It is a heavy downpour.

1327
01:38:47,056 --> 01:38:48,978
What is she doing?

1328
01:38:52,854 --> 01:38:55,484
It amazes me that some people ...

1329
01:38:56,649 --> 01:38:58,527
still survive today.

1330
01:38:58,695 --> 01:39:00,237
See you later, Albie.

1331
01:39:02,992 --> 01:39:05,618
Are you okay?
- Yes, go.

1332
01:39:07,576 --> 01:39:09,955
Everything good? He's stuck?

1333
01:39:10,247 --> 01:39:11,708
Help me.

1334
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:14,920
Help you?
What are you doing?

1335
01:39:15,084 --> 01:39:18,379
Help me to put on the cap.
- I do not know if I can help you.

1336
01:39:18,547 --> 01:39:20,049
Please, he's still so broken.

1337
01:39:20,217 --> 01:39:22,591
I can not, I'm a club owner.

1338
01:39:22,759 --> 01:39:26,095
I can pick out a beautiful model
and a beautiful color ...

1339
01:39:26,263 --> 01:39:29,598
but I can not help you.
I'm not a mechanic.

1340
01:39:29,766 --> 01:39:33,270
I'm more of a gangster.
Not true?

1341
01:39:33,438 --> 01:39:36,313
Please, help me.
- Please, help me?

1342
01:39:36,898 --> 01:39:38,067
Please.

1343
01:39:38,607 --> 01:39:39,985
Please, Reggie.

1344
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:43,572
Ok ?, I'll help you.

1345
01:39:44,489 --> 01:39:45,614
How about that?

1346
01:39:45,782 --> 01:39:48,785
This seems pretty messed up, right?

1347
01:39:49,618 --> 01:39:50,996
By the way ...

1348
01:39:52,041 --> 01:39:53,999
You look awful.

1349
01:40:39,212 --> 01:40:40,337
What are you doing?

1350
01:40:40,505 --> 01:40:42,299
Reggie, stop it. Stop.

1351
01:40:48,677 --> 01:40:49,930
Reggie.

1352
01:40:53,181 --> 01:40:55,183
Which stop?

1353
01:40:55,352 --> 01:40:57,478
Do not do it please.

1354
01:40:57,646 --> 01:40:59,440
Please stop.

1355
01:40:59,608 --> 01:41:01,734
Please. No.

1356
01:41:02,026 --> 01:41:03,302
Stop.

1357
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:14,579
Life goes on without me.

1358
01:41:18,627 --> 01:41:20,128
Where are you going?

1359
01:41:21,794 --> 01:41:23,420
I leave Reggie.

1360
01:41:24,004 --> 01:41:26,675
That is a pity that it will fall hard.

1361
01:41:27,259 --> 01:41:29,261
Please go to the side, Ron.

1362
01:41:29,594 --> 01:41:31,640
Unless you'd prefer me to stay.

1363
01:41:33,974 --> 01:41:36,393
You go, boys.

1364
01:41:40,729 --> 01:41:42,150
I will help you with your bags?

1365
01:41:42,483 --> 01:41:44,360
No thanks.
- Come on, do not be stupid.

1366
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:48,364
See how great I am compared to you.
Come on.

1367
01:41:48,945 --> 01:41:52,240
You know, Frances, sometimes you achieve greatness ...

1368
01:41:52,408 --> 01:41:54,743
Really, you have a small part
cut yourself ...

1369
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:57,622
How much does it well,
to grow and move forward.

1370
01:41:57,790 --> 01:42:00,416
It takes courage and I admire that.

1371
01:42:00,749 --> 01:42:03,628
In fact, I think
you just leave on time.

1372
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,462
Do you think?
- Yes.

1373
01:42:06,631 --> 01:42:08,801
There are so many people
who know a lot about us.

1374
01:42:08,965 --> 01:42:10,511
Not you, of course.

1375
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:14,891
Most people hate us.

1376
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,187
Sooner or later someone will talk
and the game will be over.

1377
01:42:19,728 --> 01:42:21,690
That would not be so bad, does it?

1378
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:27,860
I think God but what
by should condone, do not you think?

1379
01:42:29,405 --> 01:42:31,199
Yes, God does probably.

1380
01:42:34,242 --> 01:42:37,493
He's gone too far.

1381
01:42:37,662 --> 01:42:40,372
So we are not educated.

1382
01:42:41,497 --> 01:42:42,667
I have to go.

1383
01:42:42,919 --> 01:42:44,420
Yes of course.

1384
01:42:44,584 --> 01:42:49,718
Listen, Frances,
we both love him.

1385
01:42:49,882 --> 01:42:52,008
We have both tried.

1386
01:42:52,344 --> 01:42:55,764
We just have to see what happens,
when we get there.

1387
01:42:57,934 --> 01:42:59,156
True?

1388
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:02,895
In heaven.

1389
01:43:09,986 --> 01:43:11,403
Goodbye, Ron.

1390
01:43:12,156 --> 01:43:13,613
Goodbye, Frances.

1391
01:43:15,243 --> 01:43:16,700
Listen...

1392
01:43:18,078 --> 01:43:22,038
I've always liked you.
Really, Frances.

1393
01:43:22,498 --> 01:43:26,210
Because you have the ability
to look into the future.

1394
01:43:26,586 --> 01:43:31,299
You can do that. The same goes for me.

1395
01:43:32,176 --> 01:43:33,425
Bye.

1396
01:44:18,386 --> 01:44:19,679
Hello, Reggie.

1397
01:44:20,432 --> 01:44:21,725
How are you?

1398
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:23,475
All right, Frank?

1399
01:44:23,643 --> 01:44:26,438
Long time no see.
- I'm on the right path.

1400
01:44:26,502 --> 01:44:29,465
Really? How nice.

1401
01:44:30,442 --> 01:44:31,691
Very nice.

1402
01:44:32,276 --> 01:44:33,653
What can I do for you?

1403
01:44:34,738 --> 01:44:36,156
Frances is there?

1404
01:44:37,905 --> 01:44:41,745
I'm already weeks before her parents' home.

1405
01:44:41,909 --> 01:44:44,872
They did not say that she was left ...

1406
01:44:45,497 --> 01:44:48,292
So I stood there like a fool under her window.

1407
01:44:50,754 --> 01:44:53,381
She's here.
- I know.

1408
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:57,385
Reggie, I ...
- What?

1409
01:45:00,095 --> 01:45:03,267
I have not seen her for so long.

1410
01:45:04,268 --> 01:45:06,770
She is sensitive.
- Right.

1411
01:45:06,934 --> 01:45:10,774
Go call Frances.
I had to come here. Go get her.

1412
01:45:10,838 --> 01:45:13,717
Reggie, I do not want you to see her.
- Do not go screwing around.

1413
01:45:14,985 --> 01:45:19,575
Frances, go inward. What are you doing?
- Do not worry. Hello, Reggie.

1414
01:45:20,656 --> 01:45:22,126
Hello, Frances.

1415
01:45:24,412 --> 01:45:27,955
Do you have a minute?
Then we can talk.

1416
01:45:28,023 --> 01:45:29,877
It's OK?.
- Sure?

1417
01:45:31,879 --> 01:45:34,169
Go put in tea.

1418
01:45:37,425 --> 01:45:38,926
Frankie, come home.

1419
01:45:40,051 --> 01:45:41,553
I am home.

1420
01:45:42,761 --> 01:45:46,766
Until I find another place, at least.
I can not live with my mother.

1421
01:45:48,444 --> 01:45:51,015
What can I do to your mind
to let it change?

1422
01:45:51,879 --> 01:45:53,316
You can not.

1423
01:45:55,651 --> 01:45:58,614
I've changed my mind about one thing ??.
- And that is?

1424
01:45:59,655 --> 01:46:04,452
I want that you will always remember me.

1425
01:46:05,453 --> 01:46:09,625
I existed and I once walked beside you.
- What are you talking about?

1426
01:46:10,417 --> 01:46:11,919
Frankie, come on.

1427
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:16,672
I thought we'd have children.

1428
01:46:17,713 --> 01:46:20,760
Why?
So you can use them to threaten me?

1429
01:46:20,928 --> 01:46:22,217
No.

1430
01:46:23,218 --> 01:46:24,848
Because I still love you.

1431
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:31,102
You just say out of loyalty
for something that did not exist.

1432
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:35,067
Not true. Loving you is the only
that makes me not collapse.

1433
01:46:39,947 --> 01:46:44,908
I wish we could live a life
outside the one we are destined for.

1434
01:46:46,994 --> 01:46:49,973
But you're a gangster and you love it.

1435
01:46:50,245 --> 01:46:53,669
No, Frances, listen.

1436
01:46:55,795 --> 01:47:01,340
Let me pain
I have caused to make up, please.

1437
01:47:02,177 --> 01:47:03,342
Please.

1438
01:47:05,428 --> 01:47:07,222
Let me take you anywhere you go.

1439
01:47:07,931 --> 01:47:12,103
Somewhere?
- Does not matter where. What you want.

1440
01:47:13,352 --> 01:47:16,107
Just us two, so we can be together.

1441
01:47:17,733 --> 01:47:19,610
It's like a second honeymoon.

1442
01:47:20,443 --> 01:47:24,571
Or not.
As long as you know that I can change.

1443
01:47:26,241 --> 01:47:28,743
And I've changed.

1444
01:47:32,331 --> 01:47:38,045
I only say that the center of the world
could be anywhere.

1445
01:47:38,629 --> 01:47:39,879
Everywhere.

1446
01:47:41,172 --> 01:47:43,510
Ibiza.
- What?

1447
01:47:43,658 --> 01:47:47,887
Ibiza. Let's go there.
I think the word so beautiful.

1448
01:47:48,055 --> 01:47:50,805
I also think it sounds beautiful.

1449
01:47:51,474 --> 01:47:56,811
Want to go to Ibiza?
I book the tickets today.

1450
01:48:50,365 --> 01:48:53,244
<i> God will not ask whether we accept this life. </i>

1451
01:48:53,536 --> 01:48:56,999
<i> There is no choice.
Life is forced upon you. </i>

1452
01:48:57,540 --> 01:49:03,089
<i> You can only choose how you live it.
Or not, that's also a choice. </i>

1453
01:49:19,730 --> 01:49:21,933
<i> A cup of tea can solve everything. </i>

1454
01:49:22,397 --> 01:49:28,070
<i> Sick? Tea.
Did you leave your husband? Tea is the solution. </i>

1455
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:31,240
Damn, Frances.
What have you done?

1456
01:49:31,906 --> 01:49:36,995
<i> For as you thought, "Frances probably still alive,
otherwise they can not tell you this. "</i>

1457
01:49:37,247 --> 01:49:39,374
<i> Now you know so. </i>

1458
01:49:40,166 --> 01:49:44,919
<i> But I was finally free.
God finally gave me a lucky break. </i>

1459
01:49:45,087 --> 01:49:46,505
Where is she?

1460
01:49:47,742 --> 01:49:49,075
In her bedroom.

1461
01:50:51,862 --> 01:50:55,866
<i> That afternoon Reggie drank himself completely lamb. </i>

1462
01:50:56,703 --> 01:51:02,709
<i> What do you do differently,
if the only person you could get gone? </i>

1463
01:51:03,125 --> 01:51:06,837
<i> A cup of tea?
I did not think. </i>

1464
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:32,239
E? A big hat.

1465
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:38,047
Sit down.
Do not stand there like a lamppost.

1466
01:52:42,363 --> 01:52:43,576
Move.

1467
01:52:43,845 --> 01:52:49,802
What is missing here? A bottle. Hurry up.
- Coming.

1468
01:52:56,619 --> 01:52:59,069
You wanted to see me, Ron?
- Indeed.

1469
01:52:59,138 --> 01:53:03,572
I want you to kill someone.
I'll give you ?1,000 for.

1470
01:53:04,067 --> 01:53:05,364
Leslie.

1471
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:11,666
That is 500, the half.

1472
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:14,238
You get the rest when it happened.

1473
01:53:14,576 --> 01:53:18,765
You can not count, but everything is there.
You can do it in your pocket.

1474
01:53:20,278 --> 01:53:21,744
It's for you.

1475
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:26,013
Put the damn in your pocket.
We know you have no money.

1476
01:53:26,825 --> 01:53:28,238
Do not be so stupid.

1477
01:53:31,415 --> 01:53:32,619
Who is it?

1478
01:54:01,503 --> 01:54:03,160
Mom, wait here.

1479
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:15,759
Stop, Mom.
- You killed her.

1480
01:54:15,893 --> 01:54:19,535
You killed my daughter, asshole.

1481
01:54:21,543 --> 01:54:27,190
<i> ?100 per week to spend flowers,
does not bring her back. Killer. </i>

1482
01:54:27,358 --> 01:54:31,916
<i> You'll rot in hell, Reggie Kray. </i>

1483
01:55:15,883 --> 01:55:18,016
McVitie, what are you doing here?

1484
01:55:18,393 --> 01:55:21,823
I have a message from Ron for you.

1485
01:55:33,453 --> 01:55:34,626
Away.

1486
01:56:09,104 --> 01:56:11,782
I'll send an attorney,
or who have already arranged?

1487
01:56:15,537 --> 01:56:19,421
I want security
my wife and children is guaranteed.

1488
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,813
Payne.

1489
01:56:33,717 --> 01:56:35,532
He gave everything.

1490
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:40,174
Names, dates, times.

1491
01:56:40,636 --> 01:56:43,062
Documents, everything.

1492
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:47,455
All the pieces will fit together ...

1493
01:56:48,737 --> 01:56:51,396
and they have a dozen witnesses
they protect.

1494
01:56:54,945 --> 01:56:56,451
Nipper ...

1495
01:56:59,712 --> 01:57:01,636
Nipper, what?

1496
01:57:04,994 --> 01:57:09,721
He retrieved the barmaid again.

1497
01:57:11,938 --> 01:57:13,684
She does not get out.

1498
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:21,089
Where's Ron?

1499
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:39,030
This song is part of me.
Great song.

1500
01:57:39,194 --> 01:57:40,498
It's your favorite.

1501
01:57:54,052 --> 01:57:56,900
Opzouten, sentimental dick.

1502
01:57:57,157 --> 01:57:58,361
What?

1503
01:57:59,325 --> 01:58:02,337
He still goes through, Ian.

1504
01:58:03,434 --> 01:58:06,316
What?
- Do not start him.

1505
01:58:06,842 --> 01:58:09,978
Opzouten.
- Well, thanks for asking.

1506
01:58:14,603 --> 01:58:18,881
Be a little happier, my friend.
It is almost Christmas.

1507
01:58:19,498 --> 01:58:21,664
Why do not you dance?

1508
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:28,952
Why would you come to a party,
if you are not going to entertain yourself?

1509
01:58:29,996 --> 01:58:32,097
I'm waiting for Jack the Hat.

1510
01:58:33,803 --> 01:58:38,978
What does he do now?
He swings with his gun clubs?

1511
01:58:39,696 --> 01:58:43,126
What did you think going after Leslie Payne,
would bring us?

1512
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:46,499
What was I thinking?
- You heard me.

1513
01:58:47,694 --> 01:58:52,923
If you do not know,
I do not have to justify myself to you.

1514
01:58:57,861 --> 01:59:01,048
There he is.
Ron, let's see how.

1515
01:59:03,081 --> 01:59:06,111
Hello, where are the women?
- Jack the Hat.

1516
01:59:06,479 --> 01:59:08,980
Mr. Bender, how is it?
Good to see you.

1517
01:59:10,604 --> 01:59:11,792
Esther?
- Jackie.

1518
01:59:11,825 --> 01:59:14,395
I should never have let you go,
that was a mistake.

1519
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:20,205
I'm going to get a drink.
When I return, I'll tell you why.

1520
01:59:27,052 --> 01:59:28,221
Ron.

1521
01:59:35,566 --> 01:59:36,699
Teddy.

1522
01:59:37,783 --> 01:59:43,241
Look, Ron. Jack is there.
- What is it?

1523
01:59:51,977 --> 01:59:56,828
A cigarette, Jack.
- I just stopped.

1524
02:00:04,711 --> 02:00:06,919
Would you lost something, Reg?

1525
02:00:09,422 --> 02:00:11,310
About you.

1526
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:13,878
Leslie Payne?

1527
02:00:15,595 --> 02:00:17,727
What were you thinking?

1528
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:21,288
You ruined it.

1529
02:00:22,152 --> 02:00:25,208
I do not know what you're talking about.
- Do not lie to me.

1530
02:00:27,499 --> 02:00:30,519
I let myself if not treated.
- What do you want, Jack?

1531
02:00:30,584 --> 02:00:33,072
Shut up.
- He will not help you.

1532
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:34,995
You're not right in the head.

1533
02:00:35,064 --> 02:00:37,783
Review what happened to Frances
not at me.

1534
02:00:38,553 --> 02:00:39,775
What did you say?

1535
02:00:40,233 --> 02:00:44,640
It's not my fault that Frances suicide
committed. The pills did she not mine.

1536
02:00:44,709 --> 02:00:47,314
Are you joking?
- Reggie.

1537
02:00:47,683 --> 02:00:49,269
Shoot him.

1538
02:00:49,406 --> 02:00:52,458
Say that again.
- Reggie.

1539
02:00:52,727 --> 02:00:55,872
Say her name. I challenge you.

1540
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:03,446
Frances.

1541
02:01:41,405 --> 02:01:43,662
Why did you do that?

1542
02:01:48,111 --> 02:01:53,077
Because I can not murder you,
how much I want too.

1543
02:02:24,184 --> 02:02:25,481
<i> Reggie? </i>

1544
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:31,065
Reggie?

1545
02:02:31,769 --> 02:02:35,168
Reg, look at me.
What happened to you on?

1546
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:40,539
You kill a man in a room full of people.
Are you crazy?

1547
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:43,553
What?

1548
02:04:01,146 --> 02:04:04,616
<i> Reggie once said that the center of the world
could be anywhere. </i>

1549
02:04:05,018 --> 02:04:07,862
<i> Even here, in the east of London. </i>

1550
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:14,147
<i> The world looks like London.
Not good or bad, but it just exists. </i>

1551
02:04:14,616 --> 02:04:18,756
<i> There is no morality or shame,
only your own, solitary rules ... </i>

1552
02:04:18,825 --> 02:04:22,130
<i> until your life is over.
Until the end. </i>

1553
02:04:22,395 --> 02:04:26,327
<i> So we're just ghosts
of the people we once were. </i>

1554
02:04:48,074 --> 02:04:51,713
<i> Reggie had to sit 33 years
for the murder of Jack McVitie. </i>

1555
02:04:52,315 --> 02:04:57,610
<i> All these years, to the end,
He had a pair of tickets with him. </i>

1556
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:03,394
<i> Reggie, my prince.
I thought we were going to Ibiza. </i>

1557
02:05:08,195 --> 02:05:14,594
Reggie Kray was released eight weeks before he
died of cancer on 01-10-2000. He was 66.

1558
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:22,922
Ronald Kray was found guilty
for the murder of George Cornell.

1559
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:26,102
He was declared insane
and stayed at the Broadmoor psychiatric ...

1560
02:05:26,267 --> 02:05:28,479
until he died of a heart attack on 17-03-1995.
